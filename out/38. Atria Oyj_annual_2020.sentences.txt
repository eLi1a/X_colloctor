[p.005] Our net sales increased, and all our business segments improved their results compared with the previous year.
[p.005] We also published our new strategy to become the winning northern European food company.
[p.005] 2020 was an exceptional year.
[p.005] The new year began with high expectations – everyone expected a normal continuation of 2019.
[p.005] At the turn of the year, we had all seen and heard on the news that a new viral respiratory infection had been discovered in Wuhan in China.
[p.005] From a European perspective, it felt far away at the time, but by February, the same virus was already putting Europe on the rack as well.
[p.005] From then on, 2020 became a year of living with Covid-19.
[p.005] Atria did well in navigating the exceptional year.
[p.005] The company’s net sales increased by EUR 52.7 million to a total of EUR 1,504.0 million.
[p.005] Our EBIT increased to EUR 40.5 million from approximately EUR 31 million, which is 30 % increase from 2019.
[p.005] All our business segments improved their results compared with the previous year.
[p.005] Free cash flow increased from the previous year by more than EUR 7 million and was EUR 59.0 million in 2020.
[p.005] *** The food industry is characterised by steady overall demand even in exceptional circumstances.
[p.005] Variation only occurs in where people buy their food and the food they buy.
[p.005] Due to the restrictions implemented to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and the voluntary measures taken by various parties, people did not move about as much.
[p.005] Restrictions were placed on hobbies, and some people started working remotely.
[p.005] At times, the restaurant business was shut down completely.
[p.005] As people spent more time at home, they purchased their food from retailers.
[p.005] In turn, fewer people were eating out.
[p.005] Atria’s sales to retailers increased by 10 per cent, while sales to Food Service customers decreased by 20%.
[p.005] In the summer, our sales development took a fascinating turn: as the number of corona cases decreased, and things returned to normal for a while, sales to Food Service customers quickly recovered to their previous level.
[p.005] There seems to be a strong tendency to return to our previous way of life as soon as the situation allows it.
[p.005] *** Poultry consumption continues to increase.
[p.005] This is a global phenomenon.
[p.005] Pork consumption in Finland has been decreasing for a few years, and the same downward trend continued in 2020.
[p.005] Beef consumption has remained unchanged.
[p.005] One interesting development is the growth of the sausage market – the coronavirus has brought us back to basics, to classics such as sausages.
[p.005] These basics include chicken and minced meat.
[p.005] It was a rocky year for convenience foods, as people prepared more meals at home than usual.

[p.006] It is time to make more use of this data.
[p.006] We want to be a first-class partner for our customers.
[p.006] During the pandemic, many of us at Atria have learned a lot of things the hard way.
[p.006] More than ever, we have come to understand the value of long-term partnerships and the difficulty of building new networks.
[p.006] I want to thank all our customers for placing your trust in Atria.
[p.006] 2020 was a tough year for our personnel.
[p.006] We have had to work in exceptional circumstances, in a situation where nobody knows how long the unusual arrangements will last.
[p.006] However, everyone has done a great job, and both individual employees and different parts of the organisation have clearly demonstrated their willingness to take responsibility.
[p.006] This willpower and the performance it has driven have kept the situation under control.
[p.006] Thank you all.

[p.011] Other key goals included improving profitability, accelerating growth and increasing shareholder value systematically over the long term.
[p.011] During the 2016–2020 strategy period, Atria aimed to grow in a mainly organic manner by developing and expanding its existing operations.
[p.011] The company sought to drive growth by developing new product segments and expanding into new market areas.
[p.011] In this respect, the most significant achievement was entry into the Chinese pork market.
[p.011] Alongside organic growth, Atria actively identified opportunities for acquisitions and other arrangements generating healthy growth.
[p.011] These supplemented existing business operations, as well as offering opportunities to create entirely new product segments or enter new market areas.
[p.011] The most significant acquisitions in Finland were the Kaivon Liha Kaunismaa beef and the Domretor convenience food companies.

[p.013] Remote meetings will become more common, reducing the need for business trips.
[p.013] The coronavirus also serves as a stern warning that will make us treat infectious diseases in general with more respect and caution going forward.” Atria handled the Covid-19 pandemic well The year 2020 was strongly marked by the Covid-19 pandemic.
[p.013] The highly contagious coronavirus disease spread far and wide across the world, impacting the lives of individual people, and companies and entire countries.
[p.013] When the infectious disease reached Europe, and Atria’s countries of operations in particular, we immediately set the main company-wide goals for preventing its spread.
[p.013] Atria’s goals for preventing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remained the same throughout the period under review: preventing the spread of the virus; protecting our personnel; and safeguarding Atria’s operations throughout the chain.
[p.013] The exceptional situations and changes in the operating environment also required management to step up to the plate.
[p.013] The management teams of the Group and the individual business areas were involved in outlining Atria’s approach.
[p.013] The Covid-19 task forces established by the Group and all business areas were responsible for maintaining a continuous view of the situation, drafting new guidelines and planning new practices.
[p.013] Atria followed the instructions and guidelines issued by the authorities in all its operations.
[p.013] The SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly transmitted through droplets, but also through aerosols at close range.
[p.013] There have been no confirmed cases of contact transmission through packaging, food products or goods.
[p.013] The most important new practices implemented by Atria were based on preventing the spread of the coronavirus with respiratory protection, good hand hygiene and social distancing.
[p.013] Many people at Atria started working remotely early in the spring of 2020, and this will continue in the spring of 2021.
[p.013] Atria issued guidelines on travel, including travel bans, and limited gatherings and visits to our locations.
[p.013] Atria has solid safety systems in place even in normal times.
[p.013] We are used to working in the sphere of foodrelated microbes, and are familiar with risk management and product safety practices.
[p.013] The same risk minimisation tools and product safety management practices are also well-suited to tackling the coronavirus.
[p.013] In addition, we have had to take into account that this is a human infectious disease, a human pandemic.
[p.013] Atria handled the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic well.
[p.013] Apart from the new practices, the epidemic did not greatly affect our operations, and Atria was able to meet consumer demand and customer requirements.

[p.023] Net sales were boosted by increased sales to the retail sector and export customers.
[p.023] Pork exports to China increased significantly and the sales of Atria’s product categories in the Finnish retail trade also grew more strongly than in the previous year.
[p.023] Sales to Food Service customers decreased significantly due to the coronavirus pandemic.
[p.023] EBIT (EUR million) Atria Finland’s EBIT increased EUR 3.1 million from the previous year to EUR 43.1 million.
[p.023] This was 4.0% of net sales.
[p.023] Profitability improved mostly because of increased net sales, improved productivity and effective cost control.
[p.023] Strong growth under challenging circumstances The year 2020 was good for Atria Finland’s growth and profitability.
[p.023] Despite the coronavirus pandemic making our operating environment exceptionally challenging and uncertain, we succeeded to make stronger progress than in the previous year in two of our main channels, retail trade and exports.
[p.023] In our third main channel, the Food Service sector, the measures taken to limit the coronavirus pandemic reduced the industry’s total earnings by about one-fifth.
[p.023] Atria’s development was similar to the general development of the industry.
[p.023] The coronavirus pandemic also changed the Finnish consumer demand for food dramatically.
[p.023] Demand for food grew at the same rate as cooking at home, and good home-cooked meals became highly valued.
[p.023] This was directly reflected in Atria’s sales to the retail sector.
[p.023] The market for Atria’s cooking, poultry and consumer-packed meat product categories grew by almost 10%.
[p.023] Atria’s supplier share grew in all product categories, as did the sales of Atria’s own brands.
[p.023] Overall development was strong.
[p.023] The same is true of Atria’s pork exports to China: they more than doubled from the previous year to over 20 million kilos.
[p.023] This was almost 30% of the pork produced by the Nurmo plant.
[p.023] The consumption of meat in Finland remained stable.
[p.023] Ninety-three per cent of Finns eat meat – and specifically meat produced in Finland.
[p.023] About 83% of all meat consumed in Finland was domestically produced.
[p.023] These figures are very important for Atria’s future growth.
[p.023] After all, the year 2020 saw the largest investment decision in our history, amounting to approximately EUR 155 million, to build a new poultry unit near the Nurmo plants.

[p.038] In local currency, net sales grew by 3%.
[p.038] Sales improved especially towards the end of the year.
[p.038] EBIT (EUR million) Atria Russia’s operating loss fell slightly from the previous year and was EUR -2.9 million.
[p.038] Profitability began to improve in the second half of the year as sales strengthened.
[p.038] Growth in retail sales Atria Russia has three sales channels for its product categories: the retail sector, Sibylla customers and Food Service customers.
[p.038] Of these three, only the retail sector remained open almost as usual throughout the pandemic year.
[p.038] Atria’s sales to the retail trade developed well both in terms of sales volume and value in local currency.
[p.038] The growth was driven above all by the premium Casademont brand.
[p.038] The sales of its product categories increased throughout the year.
[p.038] In contrast, the sales of the low-price Pit-Product brand fell.
[p.038] Price competition in the Pit product categories was fierce.
[p.038] Our cooperation with the leading Russian retail chains X5, Lenta and Okey became more diverse and Atria was also able to expand its offering geographically.
[p.038] The development of the Sibylla concept was varied.
[p.038] Orders fell sharply when the pandemic started in the spring, but started to recover in the summer and eventually increased from the previous year.
[p.038] The number of Sibylla sales outlets in Russia increased by about 200 to a total of about 4,300.
[p.038] Orders and deliveries through Atria’s third channel, Food Service customers, fell considerably.
[p.038] The operating conditions for the whole industry deteriorated dramatically: the number of bankruptcies was high and restaurant sales fell by about 40% from the previous year.
[p.038] Although Atria’s production and commercial operations developed favourably in the demanding circumstances, the profitability of the operations remained poor.
[p.038] The weak performance was partly due to higher raw material prices.
[p.038] Depending on the type of meat, prices rose by 10–15%.

[p.045] As of March, the operating environment changed into something entirely different than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[p.045] Atria’s organisation and people demonstrated an excellent ability to adjust to changes and a desire to stick to the set goals and targets.
[p.045] From the very start of the pandemic, Atria set itself two goals: continuing deliveries to customers without disruption and ensuring that its personnel stays healthy.
[p.045] In terms of these goals, 2020 was a successful year.
[p.045] In terms of growth and the result, Atria’s year was strong.
[p.045] The implementation of the strategy proceeded successfully.
[p.045] Atria Group’s net sales increased by nearly EUR 53 million year-on-year.
[p.045] EBIT improved by around EUR 9 million.
[p.045] One corporate acquisition was carried out in 2020: Atria acquired the entire share capital of Domretor Oy, a contract manufacturer in the food industry.
[p.045] Domretor Oy has been an associated company of Atria since 2013, when Atria acquired a 24.9% of Domretor’s shares.
[p.045] Atria’s balance sheet and financial position were good during the review period.
[p.045] Free cash flow was EUR 59.0 million (EUR 51.0 million).
[p.045] THE HEALTHY GROWTH STRATEGY PERIOD 2016–2020 Atria’s Healthy Growth strategy period concluded at the end of 2020.
[p.045] Its key objectives were to improve profitability, accelerate growth and increase shareholder value systematically over the long term.
[p.045] Atria’s goal was to grow mainly organically, by developing and expanding its existing business operations.
[p.045] The company sought to drive growth by developing new product segments and expanding into new market areas.
[p.045] Alongside organic growth, Atria actively identified opportunities for acquisitions and other arrangements generating healthy growth.
[p.045] The Healthy Growth strategy was led through three main themes: 1.
[p.045] Commercial excellence 2.
[p.045] Efficiency 3.
[p.045] Atria’s Way of Work The most important successes by theme during the 2016–2020 strategy period were as follows: 1.
[p.045] Commercial excellence • Product and packaging innovations, including entirely new type of packaging for minced meat.
[p.045] • The first pork exports to China and the increase of exporting.
[p.045] 2.
[p.045] Efficiency • The commissioning of the new pig-cutting plant representing world-class technology in 2017.
[p.045] The new investment has improved the pig-cutting plant’s productivity and the entire pork production chain’s competitiveness.
[p.045] • Significant investments in the development of Atria Sweden’s poultry business.
[p.045] • Investments in the development of the company’s own feed production.
[p.045] • Initiation of the planning and implementation of Atria Finland’s new poultry plant investment.

[p.046] The most important changes in the operating environment which influenced the new strategy related to consumers’ purchasing behaviour.
[p.046] Awareness of sustainable food choices and increased demand for convenience foods, especially poultry, are accentuated in purchasing decisions.
[p.046] The popularity of the food service channel and private labels is also increasing.
[p.046] The uncertainty in the markets over the past year has had an impact of the food industry’s outlook.
[p.046] REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 1 JANUARY–31 DECEMBER 2020 47
[p.047] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 1 JANUARY–31 DECEMBER 2020 It is essential for the achievement of the objectives to continue investments aiming to improve commercial excellence, efficiency and Atria’s Way of Work.
[p.047] In addition, it is particularly important for us to be successful in the six focal points most important in terms of our strategy’s performance.
[p.047] These focal points are: • win pig in poultry • expand in convenience foods • strengthen in Food Service, including fast food • grow profitably in Sweden • optimize red meat • drive next level in supply chain efficiency.
[p.047] Atria’s financial targets in 2021–2025 are as follows: • EBIT .............................................................5% • Equity ratio: .............................................
[p.047] 40% • Return on equity: ....................................10% • Capital distribution: ................................50% of the profit for the period • Growth above market Financial review 2020 Atria Group’s full-year net sales amounted to EUR 1504.0 million (EUR 1451.3 million).
[p.047] EBIT was EUR 40.5 million (EUR 31.1 million).
[p.047] Atria Group’s net sales increased due to good retail sector sales and exports.
[p.047] Sales to Food Service customers declined by roughly 20% compared to the previous year.
[p.047] The Group’s EBIT improved as a result of the growth in net sales, the good development of exports and lower costs..
[p.047] The exceptional circumstances brought about by the coronavirus pandemic impacted Atria’s operating environment as of the end of the first quarter.
[p.047] The national restrictions and recommendations related to restaurant activities and public food services had an impact on Atria’s business.
[p.047] The opening hours and customer numbers of restaurants have been restricted, and the reduced travel and mobility of people has also decreased food sales in fast food restaurants and service stations.
[p.047] The popularity of everyday meals sold to retail stores grew suddenly as people began preparing for the exceptional situation in late March.
[p.047] Sales volumes to fast food and Food Service customers declined considerably in April–May.
[p.047] Food Service sales began to increase alongside the gradual easing of the coronavirus restrictions and the market began to recover towards the end of the second quarter.
[p.047] Even so, it did not rebound to the level preceding the pandemic by the end of September.
[p.047] During the last quarter of the year, the restrictions were again tightened, which reduced sales to Food Service customers.
[p.047] Sales to the retail sector have been significantly higher than in the year before.
[p.047] The shift to exceptional circumstances in Atria’s operations was carried out rapidly so that the company was able to remain operational.
[p.047] The uninterrupted continuance of operations and ensuring the delivery reliability of products were Atria’s primary tasks, in addition to ensuring the personnel’s health and working capacity.
[p.047] The production plants adopted new practices aiming to prevent the spread of a possible viral infection.
[p.047] The special arrangements are still in use and have incurred extra costs.
[p.047] On the other hand, the shift to remote working and the end of business travel have accumulated savings.
[p.047] Atria has been successful in its objective of ensuring the personnel’s health and working capacity and maintaining the delivery reliability of products.
[p.047] Atria Finland’s full-year net sales were EUR 1,066.3 million (EUR 1,033.8 million).
[p.047] The increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales to the retail sector and export customers.
[p.047] The sales of Food Service products declined by 20% compared to the year before due to coronavirus restrictions.
[p.047] The company’s EBIT increased to EUR 43.1 million (EUR 40.0 million).
[p.047] The increase in EBIT was attributable to increased net sales, the good development of exports and improved productivity.
[p.047] The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in extra costs, but their negative impact on the result was mitigated by a reduction in the statutory pension insurance contribution.
[p.047] In October, Atria confirmed the decision to build a new poultry plant in Nurmo.
[p.047] The investment is the largest in Atria’s history and extremely important to the company.
[p.047] The value of the investment is approximately EUR 155 million, and it will increase Atria Finland’s poultry production capacity by approximately 40%.

[p.048] Net sales grew by 3.1% in local currency compared to the corresponding period the year before.
[p.048] The coronavirus restrictions had a negative impact on the Food Service and fast food business.
[p.048] On the other hand, sales to the retail sector grew considerably.
[p.048] This had a positive effect on the full-year net sales.
[p.048] The good sales of poultry products strengthened net sales.
[p.048] EBIT was EUR -2.0 million (EUR -6.1 million).
[p.048] EBIT was burdened by decreased sales to fast food and Food Service customers.
[p.048] In addition, the coronavirus pandemic resulted in extra costs.
[p.048] Their impact on the result was mitigated by the compensation for sick leaves paid by the state.
[p.048] Improved efficiency, lower costs and the strengthening of the Swedish krona improved profitability.
[p.048] EBIT for the comparative period includes EUR 1.4 million of costs related to personnel arrangements.
[p.048] Atria Denmark & Estonia’s full-year net sales were EUR 106.8 million (EUR 96.6 million).
[p.048] EBIT was EUR 5.3 million (EUR 4.4 million).
[p.048] The growth in net sales was attributable to a strong increase in sales to the retail sector in both Estonia and Denmark.
[p.048] The price increases implemented during the first half of the year improved net sales.
[p.048] Atria Russia’s net sales were EUR 66.7 million (EUR 73.8 million).
[p.048] Net sales grew by 3.0% in local currency.
[p.048] EBIT was EUR -2.9 million (EUR -4.0 million).
[p.048] Sales to the retail sector were significantly higher than in the year before.
[p.048] Sales of the Casademont products grew strongly throughout the review period.
[p.048] Sales of Food Service products declined due to the coronavirus restrictions, but recovered during the fourth quarter.
[p.048] The growth in EBIT was the result of increased net sales and a better sales structure.
[p.048] Events after the period under review After the review period, Atria concluded the sale of its Russian subsidiary Pit-Product to Limited Liability Company Agricultural Complex Mikhailovskiy, which belongs to the Cherkizovo Group.
[p.048] Cherkizovo is Russia’s leading meat products manufacturer and a listed company on the Moscow Stock Exchange since 2006.
[p.048] OOO Pit-Product is a wholly owned subsidiary.
[p.048] Atria has owned the company since 2005.
[p.048] At the end of 2020, the company had approximately 700 employees.
[p.048] The company produces food products for the retail and Food Service channels and owns the Gorelovo and Sinyavino plants.
[p.048] The sale transaction does not include Atria Russia’s subsidiary Sibylla Rus LLC, which conducts fast food business in Russia.
[p.048] The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2021.
[p.048] The transaction is subject to the approval of the Russian Competition Authority.
[p.048] The impact of the divested business on Atria Group’s net sales is approximately EUR 35 million.
[p.048] The business has been loss-making.
[p.048] The amount of accumulated translation differences related to Pit-Product on December 31, 2020 was EUR -45 million.
[p.048] The translation difference has arisen from exchange rate changes during Pit-Product’s ownership.
[p.048] Atria acquired Pit-Product in 2005.
[p.048] At that time, the exchange rate of the Ruble against the euro was about 34 and at the end of 2020 about 92.
[p.048] Upon divestment of a foreign subsidiary, the accumulated translation differences related to that subsidiary, presented already earlier in equity, are recognized in profit or loss.
[p.048] As the accumulated translation differences already reduce the Group’s equity, this entry will not have an effect on the Group’s equity nor cash flow.
[p.048] Translation differences are not recognized until the final completion of the transaction.
[p.048] The final purchase price will be determined at the closing of the transaction and the divestment is not expected to have any other significant effect on the consolidated result.
[p.048] After the review period, Atria announced the launch of an investment plan to reorganise Atria Sweden’s production lines and to increase productivity.
[p.048] The investment is estimated to total around EUR 30 million.
[p.048] The investment plan will thoroughly investigate the reorganisation of production lines, potential transfers and investment needs related to the construction of new production lines.
[p.048] The project will involve assessing the option of moving production from the Malmö plant to the Sköllersta plant.
[p.048] After the planning phase, the implementation of the investment will be decided on.
[p.048] If implemented, the project is expected to be fully completed during 2023.

[p.048] Euro-denominated short-term Euribors and 1–7-year long-term interest rates were negative throughout the review period.
[p.048] Sweden’s short-term Stibor rates fluctuated on both sides of zero over the year, but the longer-term SEK rates fluctuated between 0–1%.
[p.048] The coronavirus pandemic resulted in significant changes in the financial markets.
[p.048] Liquidity in short-term commercial paper markets declined significantly and the availability of financing became more uncertain as many companies wanted to increase their cash funds at the same time as investors became more cautious and some investors pulled out of the market altogether for a certain period of time.
[p.048] Atria nevertheless managed to refinance its maturing commercial papers with new ones.

[p.049] Banks shortened the maturities of the loans granted and increased margins due to the increased risks attributable to the pandemic.
[p.049] In September, Atria refinanced a EUR 30 million loan, which would have matured in June 2022, with a new EUR 30 million seven-year bullet loan.
[p.049] The Group’s liquidity remained good and is secured through undrawn committed credit facilities of EUR 85 million, which were not used at all during the review period, and a EUR 200 million commercial paper programme, which was used actively for short-term financing.
[p.049] The Group’s net interest rate expenses continued to decrease and were EUR 4.5 million (31 December 2019: 5.6 million).
[p.049] At the end of the financial period, fixed-interest debts represented 16.7% (31 December 2019: 16.0%) of the Group’s entire debt portfolio.
[p.049] Research and product development Atria’s main product groups are fresh and consumer-packed meat, poultry products, convenience foods and meat products, such as sausages and cold cuts.
[p.049] Atria seeks to serve its stakeholders by making extensive use of research and product development in its business operations to further improve current products and develop new ones.
[p.049] Atria’s expertise in market changes and consumer research is integrated into all commercial processes.
[p.049] Market and consumer insight is an integral part of strategy work, product development, marketing and sales.
[p.049] This insight consists of both figures and connective qualitative data.
[p.049] Atria Finland has a high level of market intelligence and the company aims to improve the usability of this intelligence continuously for the processes of product development, sales and marketing.
[p.049] From the perspective of the entire Finnish food industry, one could say that the level and structure of the food service market intelligence lags considerably behind the retail sector intelligence.
[p.049] During 2020, Atria developed studies aiming for a better understanding of particularly the food service market.
[p.049] Atria’s chef barometer (Kokkibarometri), completed in late 2020, sheds an entirely new light on the perceptions and experiences of restaurant professionals in the food service market.
[p.049] Atria Finland launched more than 80 new products in 2020.
[p.049] New products represented 5.6% of total product sales in 2020.
[p.049] The seasoning packets, brought to the market in time for summer, made meat easier to marinate and also reduced the carbon footprint of the packaging.
[p.049] In the autumn, the Artesaani ready-to-eat meals, composed of high-quality ingredients, the one-pan chicken requiring 15 minutes of cooking and the strips of the Murea & Nopea product family made busy everyday life slightly easier.
[p.049] Atria Finland was the first meat processing company to furnish the consumer packaging of its poultry products with a label on each product’s carbon footprint.
[p.049] The first products to carry a carbonfootprint label were poultry products from the Alatalo farm, and they were brought to stores in December 2020.
[p.049] Atria Finland’s consumer packaging will also begin to carry, in phases, easy-to-read recycling instructions which will help consumers sort and recycle product packaging in the correct way.
[p.049] Atria Sweden brought 126 new brand products to the market in 2020.
[p.049] These products represented 3.4% of net sales.
[p.049] All new products, including private label products, accounted for 4.0% of total sales.
[p.049] The most successful new products in 2020 were the Lönneberga poultry products.
[p.049] The adjustment of the food service product range to the change in demand brought about by the coronavirus pandemic was successful.
[p.049] The Atria Denmark & Estonia business area launched a total of 62 new products..
[p.049] Atria holds an approximately 17% market share in the product category of cold cuts in Denmark.
[p.049] In 2020, Atria introduced 11 new brand products in Denmark’s retail sector.
[p.049] Atria Denmark’s most successful new product in 2020 was Aalbæk Specialiteter’s sliced beef salami.
[p.049] In Denmark, new products represented 6.0% of total product sales.
[p.049] In 2020, Atria brought 51 new products to the Estonian market.
[p.049] This represents 7.3% of total sales.
[p.049] The most significant investment in product innovations was the replacement of the traditional minced meat packaging with new environmentally friendly packaging.
[p.049] Thanks to the new minced meat packaging, the amount of packaging material reduced by around 53 tonnes and increased minced meat sales by 43%.
[p.049] In terms of product development, the main focus was on expanding the product categories for healthy food and convenience food.
[p.049] The product range was complemented with poultry products and deep-fried readyto-eat products, for example.
[p.049] Atria Russia launched 43 new products in 2020.
[p.049] Most of the new products were food service products.
[p.049] The product range aimed at retail sector customers was expanded primarily with the Casademont products.
[p.049] The soft Sobrasada sausage and the quality snack product Bocaditos are examples of an entirely new type of product in Russia’s meat product market.
[p.049] The Sibylla brand was also expanded with new products, including tortillas, ready-to-eat hot dogs and helix-shaped grill sausages.
[p.049] The sales of new products accounted for 5.1% of total sales in 2020.

[p.050] The social, market economy and public health impact of the pandemic has been visible in Atria’s operations since March 2020.
[p.050] The risk’s significance has varied both in terms of business areas and seasons.
[p.050] The news concerning the vaccines received during the fourth quarter did not yet have the chance to reduce the risk.
[p.050] Instead, the virus’s capacity for mutation resulted in increased coronavirus restrictions and protective measures in some countries.
[p.050] Throughout the pandemic, Atria has invested in ensuring its employees’ health and working capacity as well as in maintaining production reliability.
[p.050] Atria’s different units have adjusted their operations according to the changed circumstances and product demand.
[p.050] Although Atria has incurred some extra costs due to hygiene requirements and the adjustment of operations, the impact on the result and cash flow has been moderate.
[p.050] The company’s financial position has also remained good.
[p.050] Governments have stimulated the economy with support measures and stimulus packages during the pandemic.
[p.050] In Finland, Atria’s operations were supported by a 2.6% reduction in the employer’s pension insurance contributions during the period between 1 May – 31 December 2020.
[p.050] In Sweden, the state compensated companies for sick leaves.
[p.050] The vaccination programmes in different countries got underway in early 2021.
[p.050] The duration of these programmes, the efficacy of various vaccines and the virus’s capacity for rapid mutation nevertheless mean that forecasting the pandemic’s effects on Atria’s 2021 result, balance sheet and cash flow is still difficult.
[p.050] Atria’s normal food production risks pertain to the quality, availability, safety and price of its raw materials and products.
[p.050] The African swine fever occurring in a number of European countries as well as in China and Russia has had an impact on the price as well as the demand and supply of pork around the world.
[p.050] Given that there is a risk of the African swine fever spreading to Finland, Atria has implemented measures aiming to prevent its spread in its own production plants and contract production farms.
[p.050] The cases of avian influenza found in Europe in late 2020, on the other hand, resulted in uncertainty in poultry markets.
[p.050] Information security issues became the subject of increasing public debate during the second half of 2020.
[p.050] Atria’s operations could also become the target of spoofing, hacking or data leakages.
[p.050] The company aims to prevent and protect itself against these risks by systematic monitoring and measures aiming to improve information security.
[p.050] Atria’s personnel is a vitally important resource for the company.
[p.050] Personnel risks are managed with the help of training and preventive measures investing in the safety of work and the personnel’s healthcare.
[p.050] These measures aim to ensure the personnel’s well-being and competence as well as the implementation of Atria’s strategy and the achievement of its goals.
[p.050] Risks and risk management The implementation of Atria’s strategy, the achievement of its goals and responsible operations call for the identification and management of favourable and unfavourable events that affect operations.
[p.050] Favourable events improve Atria’s result and financial position, while unfavourable events increase costs and hinder operations.
[p.050] Atria seeks to prevent unfavourable events and their impact on business operations through risk management as part of its day-to-day operations.
[p.050] Atria’s risk management policy and process guidelines determine goals, principles, responsibilities and authorisations for risk management, as well as operating methods for risk assessment and reporting.
[p.050] More information about Atria’s framework for risk management is available in the Corporate Governance Statement section of the Annual Report.
[p.050] For the purposes of reporting, Atria divides the risks affecting its operations into four categories: strategic, operational, liability and financial risks.
[p.050] Strategic risks relate to operational development and the planning and implementation of long-term business decisions as well as to brands, management systems, the allocation of resources and the ability to respond to changes in the operating environment.
[p.050] Atria’s Board of Directors participates in the identification and management of strategic risks.
[p.050] Operational risks are related to day-to-day business operations in processes, systems and people’s activities, for example.
[p.050] Everyone at Atria participates in the identification and management of these risks.
[p.050] Liability risks are errors, malfunctions and accidents that occur within Atria or in the business environment and that cause damage or loss.
[p.050] Liability risks are managed through continuity plans, and Atria seeks to transfer them to insurance companies.
[p.050] Financial risks have to do with changes in market prices and the sufficiency of financial assets in the short and medium terms as well as to counterparties’ ability to meet their financial obligations.
[p.050] Financial risks are managed in cooperation with financial institutions and by making use of various financial instruments in minimising risks.

[p.051] Individually or combined, these risks may have favourable or unfavourable impacts on Atria’s business operations, result, financial position, competitiveness and reputation.
[p.051] The risks shown in the table are presented in random order.
[p.051] Risks related to raw materials and their production Risk description Risk management Fluctuation in the demand for meat, animal diseases, extreme weather phenomena as well as changes in the rearing costs and capacity of contract producers have an impact on the purchase prices of the meat raw materials.
[p.051] Atria steers the purchasing of meat raw materials centrally and relies on a wide network of suppliers in the purchasing.
[p.051] Contract producers are furthermore guided in rearing and animal care.
[p.051] The quality of raw materials and products and safety in the entire production chain are of primary importance to Atria.
[p.051] Atria ensures the safety of its production processes every day and checks that various microbiological, chemical and physical risk factors are eliminated.
[p.051] Product safety is ensured in accordance with operating methods required by food safety management and quality certifications.
[p.051] The chickens and pigs on Atria Family Farms are raised without antibiotics.
[p.051] The name of the Family Farm – that is, the origin of the meat – is indicated on the product packaging.
[p.051] Food consumption and production has an environmental impact.
[p.051] Among other things, the food production chain has an impact on global warming, the eutrophication and acidification of the environment as well as the loss of biodiversity.
[p.051] In addition, it consumes nutrients, land areas, energy and water resources.
[p.051] Environmental impacts and climate change as well as efforts to combat them may have effects on Atria’s operations, result and reputation.
[p.051] Such effects may include changes in consumption and business processes, material damage, the need for technological changes, increased regulation and heavier environmental taxation.
[p.051] In accordance with its environmental policy, Atria works systematically to minimise its environmental impact.
[p.051] Atria is committed to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions and other environmental impacts both in its own production and across the food chain, from the field to the table.
[p.051] A carbon-neutral food chain by 2035 is Atria’s most important goal In-depth knowledge of the food chain and its environmental impacts is crucial for Atria.
[p.051] The company engages in close cooperation with research institutions and other industry operators.
[p.051] In addition, Atria requires its partners to operate in an environmentally responsible manner.
[p.051] Atria’s environmental impact is managed in many ways: by increasing energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources to an increasing degree, reducing waste, developing ecological packaging solutions, and using water and other natural resources responsibly.
[p.051] In addition to ensuring that its operations meet the statutory requirements, Atria promotes the development and adoption of new technologies.
[p.051] The health and welfare of animals is important for Atria.
[p.051] An animal disease at a critical point in Atria’s production chain could interrupt production in the unit concerned and disrupt operations throughout the chain.
[p.051] Animal diseases may also result in export and import restrictions imposed on meat products.
[p.051] Atria ensures animal welfare with quality requirements pertaining to production and purchasing contracts.
[p.051] Atria’s multi-stage self-monitoring aims to detect potential hazards related to animal health and welfare as early as possible.
[p.051] In Finland, contract production and the related production guidelines for each species, as well as traceability, are one of the key aspects of monitoring and further improving the welfare of Atria’s production animals.
[p.051] Atria’s contract producers have comprehensive group animal disease insurance to minimise the impacts of any damage to producers.

[p.052] This enables Atria to develop and diversify its long-term cooperation with customers.
[p.052] On the other hand, a change in the operations of an individual customer may have a bigger impact on Atria’s operations.
[p.052] In risk management, Atria makes use of its good customer cooperation, well-known brands, efficient industrial processes, high-quality products and financial monitoring.
[p.052] Changes in consumer behaviour may have an impact on both the short-term and long-term demand for Atria’s products.
[p.052] Health aspects, animal welfare, ethical considerations and climate change are examples of factors that may affect consumer behaviour.
[p.052] Changes in consumer behaviour may have positive or negative impacts on Atria’s profitability and the reputation of its brands.
[p.052] Atria is preparing for changes in demand and consumption habits and the need to adapt its operations by investing in consumer-oriented and sustainable product development.
[p.052] In addition, Atria informs consumers about its products, its own operations and its responsibility.
[p.052] Competitors’ operations and product selections, as well as private labels, affect Atria’s profitability.
[p.052] Atria develops its product range from a customer-driven perspective, monitors market changes actively, ensures the efficiency of operations, maintains good delivery reliability and invests in informative consumer marketing.
[p.052] Atria’s geographical area of operation exposes the company to risks related to the national economy, legislation and official regulations in various countries.
[p.052] Global geopolitical risks, pandemics and animal diseases may also have an effect on Atria’s operations.
[p.052] Atria manages the risk with contracts and by monitoring amendments to legislation and investing in quality matters.
[p.052] Atria also trains its personnel, relies on the services of experts and conducts audits.
[p.052] Personnel risks Risk description Risk management The availability of competent and motivated employees is a risk for Atria’s strategy implementation and the achievement of its goals.
[p.052] Atria invests in employee development and training through a wide range of training opportunities.
[p.052] Development needs are also identified through employee surveys.
[p.052] Epidemics and pandemics have an impact on the personnel’s health.
[p.052] Health risks are managed with the help of training and preventive measures investing in the safety of work, protective clothing and masks and the personnel’s healthcare.
[p.052] Low temperatures and repetitive movements are characteristic of work in the food industry.
[p.052] The work is often physically demanding and involves cutting machines and tools.
[p.052] This increases the risk of occupational accidents.
[p.052] Atria aims to prevent occupational accidents, the risks of occupational disease and the related costs by investing significantly in safety at work.

[p.053] Atria aims to minimise information security risks and accelerate the recovery from such risks with continuous and systematic monitoring.
[p.053] The company also conducts risk assessments in relation to its personnel, data communications, software, hardware, accessibility and physical security.
[p.053] Atria also relies on external experts in the management of information security risks.
[p.053] A failure to protect personal data or other important data may damage the company’s reputation and result in financial sanctions and/or liability for damages.
[p.053] Atria pays special attention to information security through technical protection and audits, and by providing employees with training and guidelines.
[p.053] Liability risks Risk description Risk management Unforeseeable liability risks at Atria’s production plants in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Estonia or Russia may interrupt operations at a production plant.
[p.053] All Atria’s production plants are insured against any physical damage and interruptions in operations through the Group’s insurance policies.
[p.053] A risk analysis is prepared annually or every two years at key plants.
[p.053] Continuity planning is in place to limit the potential damage caused by business interruptions.
[p.053] Financial risks Risk description Risk management Key risks related to financing in Atria’s operations include currency transaction and translation risks, the interest rate risk, and the liquidity and refinancing risk.
[p.053] The goal of financial risk management is to reduce the impact of price fluctuations in financial markets and other uncertainty factors on earnings, the balance sheet and cash flow, in addition to ensuring sufficient liquidity.
[p.053] Note 29 to the financial statements contains more detailed information on Atria’s management of financial risks.
[p.053] Atria’s risk management has mapped risks related to human rights, corruption and bribery.
[p.053] None of these risks have been detected or materialised in Atria’s operations.
[p.053] To prevent risks of this kind in the future as well, Atria maintains partnership principles and a purchasing policy.
[p.053] The implementation of these principles and the policy are monitored with the help of assessments and audits.

[p.055] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 REPORT BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 1 JANUARY–31 DECEMBER 2020 Incentive schemes for management and key personnel Long-term share-based incentive scheme 2018–2020 In 2017, Atria Plc’s Board of Directors decided on the long-term incentive scheme for key personnel for 2018–2020.
[p.055] The share-based incentive scheme aimed to encourage Atria’s management to acquire company shares, as well as to increase the company’s value through their decisions and actions over the long term.
[p.055] The scheme, based on a shares and a cash bonus, is divided into three one-year periods.
[p.055] The third earning period began on 1 January 2020 and ended on 31 December 2020.
[p.055] The possible bonus in the scheme is based on the company’s earnings per share (70%) and organic growth (30%).
[p.055] The bonuses for the 2020 earning period are paid in three equal instalments in 2021, 2022 and 2023, partly as company shares and partly in cash.
[p.055] The cash proportion aims to cover any taxes and tax-like payments incurred by the person due to the bonus.
[p.055] If the person’s employment relationship or service contract ends prior to the payment of the bonus, the bonus is not usually paid.
[p.055] The share-based incentive scheme covers a maximum of 40 people.
[p.055] The bonuses to be paid for the 2020 earning period are estimated at EUR 0.9 million.
[p.055] The concluded long-term incentive scheme Payments for the 2015–2017 earning period were based on the Group’s earnings per share (EPS), excluding extraordinary items.
[p.055] The cash bonuses payable under the scheme for the 2015–2017 earning period were capped at EUR 4.5 million.
[p.055] The scheme ended on 31 December 2017, and it covered a maximum of 45 people, including the CEO, the Group’s Management Team and the management teams of the business areas.
[p.055] The bonuses accrued for the 2015–2017 earning period totalled EUR 2.1 million.
[p.055] The final bonus instalment was paid in March 2020 and it amounted to EUR 0.2 million.
[p.055] Short-term incentive scheme The maximum bonus payable under Atria Plc’s short-term incentive plan is 25–50% of the annual salary, depending on the performance impact and requirement level of each individual’s role.
[p.055] The criteria in the bonus scheme are the performance requirements and net sales at Group level and in the individual’s area of responsibility.
[p.055] In addition to the CEO and other members of the Group’s Management Team, Atria Plc’s bonus schemes cover around 40 people.
[p.055] New long-term incentive scheme for 2021–2023 Atria Plc’s Board of Directors has decided on a long-term incentive scheme for key personnel for 2021–2023.
[p.055] The scheme is basically identical to the scheme for 2018–2020.
[p.055] The new scheme, based on a shares and a cash bonus, is divided into three one-year periods, with the first earning period beginning on 1 January 2021 and ending on 31 December 2021.
[p.055] The bonuses for the 2021 earning period are paid in three equal parts in 2022, 2023 and 2024, partly as company’s exchange shares and partly in cash.
[p.055] The cash proportion aims to cover any taxes and tax-like payments incurred by the person due to the bonus.
[p.055] If the person’s employment relationship or service contract ends prior to the payment of the bonus, the bonus is not usually paid.
[p.055] The share-based incentive scheme covers a maximum of 40 people.
[p.055] The maximum value of the bonuses to be paid on the basis of one earning period is EUR 2 million.
[p.055] The new incentive scheme aims to encourage Atria’s management to acquire company shares and to enhance the company’s long-term increase in value by their decisions and activities.
[p.055] Outlook for 2021 Atria Group’s adjusted EBIT in 2021 is expected to be EUR 37–43 million (EUR 40.5 million).
[p.055] The adjusted EBIT is determined by adjusting the EBIT recognised in the income statement for items materially affecting comparability.
[p.055] These may include events that are not part of ordinary business activities, such as the restructuring of operations, capital gains and losses attributable to the sale of operations, impairment, and the costs of discontinuing significant operations.
[p.055] If materialised, the translation difference recognised as a result of the disposal of OOO Pit-Product would be such an item with an effect on the result.
[p.055] The translation differences related to Pit-Product accumulated by 31 December 2020 were approximately EUR -45 million.
[p.055] The recognised translation differences depend on the development of the exchange rate of the Russian rouble and they will be recognised when the deal is closed.
[p.055] Atria operates mainly in retail and food service markets in Finland and Sweden.
[p.055] Significant and sudden changes in the global meat market are having an increasingly strong impact on the company’s development, in addition to reducing predictability.
[p.055] The consumption of poultry is expected to further increase, while the consumption red meat is expected to decrease slightly.
[p.055] Atria has increased its export of meat, and pork exports to China, for example, are expected to continue to grow in 2021.
[p.055] The coronavirus pandemic which emerged in 2020 and was still present at the beginning of 2021 has resulted in strong and rapid changes in the food industry’s operating environment.
[p.055] This has made forecasting of the company’s development more difficult.
[p.055] Direct impacts on Atria’s business include the national restrictions imposed on restaurant activities and public food services, which reduce sales to Food Service customers.
[p.055] The importance of everyday meals has grown during the pandemic.
[p.055] Any possible deterioration in consumers’ purchasing power would also have an impact on grocery purchases and could prove unfavourable in terms of the sales of Atria’s products.

[p.058] In the audits, attention is paid to food safety, for example, as well as environmental and social responsibility, such as human rights and the prevention of corruption and bribery.
[p.058] Atria has established a whistleblowing channel for its employees to report suspected breaches of the Code of Conduct or illegal activities.
[p.058] All reports are processed confidentially, and Atria implements any necessary measures based on the reports.
[p.058] The related indicator is the number of reports submitted to the whistleblowing channel or to the authorities.

[p.058] The goals of environmental management at Atria’s plants have been adjusted to changes in the operating environment.
[p.058] Priorities include energy efficiency, water efficiency and the prevention of waste and food waste, as well as ensuring statutory compliance in operations.
[p.058] Concerning the food chain as a whole, a carbon-neutral food chain by 2035 is Atria’s most important environmental goal.
[p.058] The means and measures for achieving a carbon-neutral food chain and the key indicators of environmental responsibility are reported in more detail in the Corporate Responsibility Report.
[p.058] Producers play a key role in mitigating the environmental impact of primary production.
[p.058] At the farm level, minimising environmental impacts means farm-specific solutions based on the type of production.
[p.058] Resource efficiency and good input-output ratios play a key role in terms of the environment.
[p.058] The key projects to improve the environmental efficiency of the production chain are discussed in the business area reviews in the Annual Report and in the Corporate Responsibility Report.
[p.058] Energy Sustainable, efficient energy use reduces carbon dioxide emissions, which facilitate climate change.
[p.058] Atria Group’s energy consumption in 2020 was 514,976 MWh.
[p.058] Consumption decreased by 1.3%, and consumption per kilo produced decreased by 2.8% year-on-year.
[p.058] The decrease in energy consumption was the result of a growth in the share of biofuels at Atria’s plant in Nurmo, Finland, and a general decrease in consumption achieved through energy efficiency measures, particularly in terms of heating energy.
[p.058] Atria Group’s carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by 27% from the 2016 level.
[p.058] The decrease in carbon dioxide emissions was due to the increased use of renewable energy sources, such as increasing the share of bio-based fuels in heat production.
[p.058] Water The quality, adequacy and pumping capacity of water are critical for Atria’s operations.
[p.058] Plant-specific environmental permits determine the threshold values for wastewater quality.
[p.058] All wastewater is directed to a local wastewater treatment facility.
[p.058] Atria Group’s water consumption in 2020 was 3,020,256 m3.
[p.058] Consumption decreased by 1%, and consumption per kilo produced decreased by 2% compared to 2019.
[p.058] The continuous management of water consumption is part of the plants’ environmental management and continuous improvement.
[p.058] Materials Food production is at the core of the circular economy.
[p.058] Side streams that do not end up as products are directed back to the food chain, as precisely and with as high a value as possible.
[p.058] They are used in applications of the feed industry, as nutrients, for material recycling or as energy.
[p.058] During the strategy period which concluded at the end 2020, Atria focused on strengthening an anti-wastage operating culture.
[p.058] Atria’s internal waste management aims to improve value creation for material flows suitable for food production.
[p.058] Atria’s wastage is managed in accordance with the same principles in all business areas of the Group.
[p.058] The various types of process wastage have been identified and monitoring indicators have been created for them.
[p.058] They are displayed at the departments and daily management reacts to deviations without delay.
[p.058] In addition to the personnel’s activities, wastage reduction requires investments in the processes.
[p.058] Compliance The operations of Atria’s production plants are subject to environmental permits.
[p.058] All Atria’s production plants have management systems that meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 standard for environmental systems and the requirements of the ISO 50001 standard for energy management systems.
[p.058] The Corporate Responsibility Report includes information about the system certification status.

[p.068] The company has been listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. since 1991.
[p.068] Copies of the consolidated financial statements are available online at www.atria.com and at the parent company’s head office at Itikanmäenkatu 3, Seinäjoki, Finland; postal address: PO Box 900, 60060 ATRIA, Finland.
[p.068] Atria Plc and its subsidiaries manufacture and market food products, especially meat products, poultry products, meals and food concepts.
[p.068] Atria’s main market area covers Finland, Sweden, Denmark, European Russia and the Baltic countries.
[p.068] Atria’s subsidiaries are also located in this area.
[p.068] Atria Group’s reporting segments are Atria Finland, Atria Sweden, Atria Denmark & Estonia and Atria Russia.
[p.068] The financial statements were approved for publication by the Board of Directors on 18 March 2021.
[p.068] According to the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act, the shareholders are entitled to approve or reject the financial statements at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to be held after the publication of the financial statements.
[p.068] The AGM can also decide to revise the financial statements.
[p.068] Accounting policies BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted the EU.
[p.068] The IAS and IFRS standards valid on 31 December 2020 have been followed, as well as SIC and IFRIC interpretations.
[p.068] The IFRS refer to standards and interpretations approved for application in the EU in compliance with Regulation (EC) 1606/2002, as referred to in the Finnish Accounting Act and subsequent regulations.
[p.068] The notes to the consolidated financial statements also comply with Finnish accounting and corporate legislation.
[p.068] The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on an acquisition cost basis except for biological assets, financial assets recognised at fair value in other comprehensive income, financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and derivative financial instruments.
[p.068] From the moment of classification, the assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their balance sheet value and fair value less cost to sell.
[p.068] The financial statement data is presented in thousands of euros, with sums rounded off to the nearest thousand.
[p.068] IMPACTS OF COVID-19, ACCOUNTING POLICIES CALLING FOR MANAGEMENT DISCRETION AND KEY UNCERTAINTY FACTORS RELATED TO ASSESSMENTS When preparing the financial statements, discretion must be used in applying the accounting policies.
[p.068] In addition, the management must make assessments and assumptions that concern the future and affect assets and liabilities in relation to responsibilities, profits and costs.
[p.068] The realised values may deviate from the original assessments and assumptions.
[p.068] The Group’s management makes discretionary decisions regarding the choice and application of accounting policies.
[p.068] This particularly affects cases where the valid IFRS norms include alternative recognition, measurement or presentation procedures.
[p.068] The management has exercised discretion in the valuation and classification of assets and financial items, in the recognition of deferred tax assets and provisions, and in the classification of associated companies and joint ventures as materially significant.
[p.068] The assessments are based on the management’s best estimate at the end date of the reporting period.
[p.068] They are affected by previous experiences and assumptions about the future that are deemed the most likely at the end of the period and are related to the expected developments in the Group’s financial environment.
[p.068] Any changes in the assessments and assumptions are recognised in the accounting period during which the assessment or assumption is adjusted and in all subsequent accounting periods.
[p.068] The exceptional situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the uncertainty it has created, have made it necessary for Atria’s management to critically assess the company’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses, even though the impacts of the pandemic on Atria’s operations have been moderate.
[p.068] The management has assessed the uncertainties and risks and exercised discretion when applying the accounting policies.
[p.068] The following paragraphs briefly describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the application of the company’s accounting policies.
[p.068] The actual accounting policies are presented later in the “Consolidated Accounting policies” section.
[p.068] Intangible and tangible assets and inventories: Atria’s operations have continued throughout the pandemic without interruption and sales have increased.
[p.068] There has been no need for additional depreciation and Atria’s policy regarding depreciation remains unchanged.
[p.068] Unusual impairment of goods in stock has not occurred.
[p.068] On the closing date of the reporting period, Atria also reviewed any indication of impairment of intangible assets.
[p.068] The interest rates used in the calculations have been checked.
[p.068] The Group has conducted impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
[p.068] NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS 69
[p.069] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS The calculation to test the impairment of intangible assets is based on a series of figures from a five-year strategic period which is annually assessed, taking into account any changes in the business environment, measures taken by Atria and the results achieved.
[p.069] Each of Atria’s business areas has prepared its own five-year series, and the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 has been taken into account in the first year of the series.
[p.069] Together with the business areas, the Group’s Management Team has assessed how realistic the series is during and after the pandemic, as well as the risks.
[p.069] The figures were finally also reviewed by the Board, which approved the proposals made.
[p.069] No indications of impairment were detected.
[p.069] Impairment testing and sensitivity analyses are described in more detail in Note 15.
[p.069] Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: The Group has leased properties, machinery and equipment.
[p.069] The lease contracts are made for a fixed period or are valid until further notice.
[p.069] The contract period for leases that are valid until further notice, as well as any options to extend them, are assessed on a case-by-case basis.
[p.069] COVID-19 has not affected the terms of Atria’s leases and Atria has not received any lease relief.
[p.069] Revenue recognition and management of liquidity risk: Atria’s total sales have developed favourably during the pandemic and there has been no need to change the revenue recognition policies.
[p.069] As a result of increased sales and good results, the company’s financial position and cash flow were good during the financial year and, despite the exceptional circumstances, Atria has managed to refinance its maturing commercial papers with new ones.
[p.069] Cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately EUR 30 million during the first quarter, but were reduced to levels closer to normal during the second and third quarters.
[p.069] Trade receivables: Atria’s trade receivables from consumer goods customers are short-term and do not include significant financial components.
[p.069] Consumer product customers are mainly central wholesale businesses.
[p.069] Some of the trade receivables are sold to finance companies.
[p.069] The sold trade receivables are derecognised on the balance sheet when the finance company has settled the payment for the receivables and when all material risks and benefits related to the ownership have transferred to the buyer.
[p.069] Each Group company has assessed their trade receivables and their age distribution.
[p.069] Atria has evaluated its model for expected credit losses from trade receivables, which takes into account macroeconomic developments.
[p.069] It was not necessary to make material changes to the amount of recognised credit loss provision.
[p.069] Employee benefits: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employers were given a discount of 2.6% on their TyEL contributions during the period from 1 May to 31 December 2020.
[p.069] In Sweden, the state reimbursed some of the salary costs and social security contributions for sick leaves caused by the coronavirus from 1 March to 31 December 2020.
[p.069] No grants or subsidies related to the COVID-19 pandemic were received in Atria’s other business areas.
[p.069] Acquired operations: During the review period, Atria Finland acquired the entire share capital of Domretor Oy.
[p.069] Because the assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition, Atria’s management has assessed the value of the assets, compared them with market prices and made assumptions of their future use.
[p.069] The liabilities have also been critically assessed.
[p.069] The management believes that the assessments and assumptions are sufficiently detailed to be used as the basis for fair value measurement.
[p.069] Taxes: In connection with the financial statements, Atria’s management has assessed the effect of uncertainty over tax treatment in accordance with IFRIC 23.
[p.069] Atria has not taken advantage of the tax reliefs granted by the tax authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and income taxes are recognised on the basis of the taxable result for the year.
[p.069] Deferred tax assets have been written down in Russia, because the Company did not foresee convincing evidence of future opportunities to offset tax losses.
[p.069] As a result of COVID-19 subsidies, it is not possible to use a group subsidy in Sweden to equalise the taxable results of the companies.
[p.069] This will slightly increase the income taxes paid by our Swedish companies.
[p.069] CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES a) New and amended standards, effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 Definition of ‘material’ – amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 The IASB has made amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors which use a consistent definition of materiality throughout International Financial Reporting Standards and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, clarify when information is material and incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1 about immaterial information.
[p.069] Atria takes into account the changed definition of materiality in its consolidated financial statements and for publication in the data.

[p.070] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 b) Significant new standards and interpretations that have been issued, but will not become effective until after 1 January 2020 Classification of liabilities into current or non-current items - Amendments to IAS 1 The narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period.
[p.070] Classification is unaffected by the expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date.
[p.070] The amendments also clarify what IAS 1 means when it refers to the ‘settlement’ of a liability.
[p.070] The amendments could affect the classification of liabilities, particularly for entities that previously considered management’s intentions to determine classification and for some liabilities that can be converted into equity.
[p.070] They must be applied retrospectively in accordance with the normal requirements in IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.
[p.070] In May 2020, the IASB issued an Exposure Draft proposing to defer the effective date of the amendments to 1 January 2023.
[p.070] Atria is currently assessing the impact of these amedments.
[p.070] Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements SUBSIDIARIES The consolidated financial statements include the parent company Atria Plc and all its subsidiaries.
[p.070] Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group.
[p.070] The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to or entitled to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and can affect those returns through its power over the entity.
[p.070] Subsidiaries acquired during the financial year are consolidated from the date of their acquisition and divested subsidiaries are included up to their date of sale.
[p.070] Business combinations are treated using the acquisition method of accounting.
[p.070] Consideration transferred, and the identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired business are measured at fair value at acquisition date.
[p.070] Consideration transferred includes the fair value of an asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement.
[p.070] The costs of acquisition are charged to the income statement during the period in which they are incurred and the related services are received.
[p.070] The net assets and accepted and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value at the time of the acquisition.
[p.070] The interest of non-controlling owners in the acquisition target is recognised on acquisition basis either at fair value or based on their relative share of the identifiable net assets of the acquisition target.
[p.070] Where the consideration transferred with the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the previously held interest exceed the fair value of the acquired net assets, the excess is recorded as goodwill on the balance sheet.
[p.070] If the sum of the consideration, the amount of the non-controlling interest and previously held interest is less than the fair value of the acquired net assets, the difference is recorded in the income statement.
[p.070] All intra-Group transactions, receivables and liabilities and income and expenses are eliminated.
[p.070] Profits and losses due to intra-Group transactions leading to the recognition of an asset are also eliminated.
[p.070] The accounting policies applied by subsidiaries have been revised to match the Group policies, where necessary.
[p.070] The parent company’s changes of ownership of the subsidiaries, which do not lead to a loss of control, are treated as equity transactions.
[p.070] When shares are purchased from non-controlling shareholders, the difference between the consideration paid and the balance sheet value of the share acquired of the net assets of the subsidiary is recognised in equity.
[p.070] Profit or loss from the sale of shares to non-controlling shareholders is also recognised in equity.
[p.070] When control or major influence by the Group ceases to exist, any remaining interest is measured at fair value on the date of the loss of control, and the change in balance sheet value is recognised in the income statement.
[p.070] This fair value serves as the original balance sheet value when the remaining interest is later recognised as an associated company, a joint venture or financial assets.
[p.070] In addition, the amounts of said entity previously recognised in other comprehensive income are treated as if the Group had directly disposed of the associated assets and liabilities.
[p.070] This may mean that amounts previously recognised as other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.
[p.070] ASSOCIATED COMPANIES AND JOINT ARRANGEMENTS Associates are companies in which the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, and in which the Group has significant influence, but which is does not control.
[p.070] A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.
[p.070] Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.
[p.070] A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities related to the arrangement.
[p.070] A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
[p.070] The Group’s joint arrangements are joint ventures.
[p.070] Investments in associates and joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method.
[p.070] When using the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at acquisition cost, and this amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the subsequent profits or losses of the investee after the time of acquisition.
[p.070] The Group’s investment in associates and joint ventures includes any goodwill identified on the acquisition.
[p.070] NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS 71
[p.071] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS If the interest in an associate company is reduced, but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified as profit or loss.
[p.071] The Group’s share of associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised under operating profit on the income statement.
[p.071] The balance sheet value of the investment is adjusted accordingly.
[p.071] If the Group’s share of the loss of an associate is equal to or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group will not recognise further losses if it does not have a legal or factual obligation to do so, and it has not made payments on behalf of the associate.
[p.071] FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group companies are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).
[p.071] The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR), which is the parent company’s functional currency, and the parent company’s and the Group’s presentation currency.
[p.071] Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction.
[p.071] Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate prevailing on the end of the reporting period.
[p.071] Exchange differences arising from translation are recognised in the income statement and presented in the operating profit.
[p.071] Exchange gains and losses from forward exchange agreements protecting financial transactions and foreign currency-denominated loans are included in financial income and expenses, excluding exchange rate changes of derivative financial instruments that are qualifying cash flow hedges.
[p.071] These exchange rate differences have been recognised in other comprehensive income.
[p.071] The income statements and balance sheet items of the Group companies outside the euro area are accounted for in the currency that is the currency of the operating region of the company in question.
[p.071] The income statements of Group companies outside the euro area are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the reporting period and the balance sheets at the closing exchange rate.
[p.071] Differences resulting from the translation are recognised as part of translation differences in other comprehensive income.
[p.071] The translation differences arising from the elimination of the acquisition costs of subsidiaries outside the euro area and the hedge profits derived from the corresponding net investments are also recognised in other comprehensive income.
[p.071] When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange rate differences in equity are recognised in the income statement.
[p.071] Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of the foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
[p.071] The exchange differences arising from this are recognised in other comprehensive income.
[p.071] PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recognised at the cost of purchase or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
[p.071] If the tangible fixed asset consists of several parts with different useful lives, each part is treated as a separate asset.
[p.071] The costs arising from replacing the part are capitalised.
[p.071] Other subsequent expenditure is included in the acquisition cost only if it is probable that the future benefit connected to the asset will benefit the Group, and the acquisition cost of the asset can be reliably determined.
[p.071] All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
[p.071] Depreciation is recorded using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: • Buildings ..................................................25–50 years • Machinery and equipment ....................5–30 years • Other tangible assets ..............................
[p.071] 5–10 years No depreciation is carried out on land and water.
[p.071] Asset items that cannot be recognised under property, plant and equipment due to their nature or depreciation periods are recognised as other tangible assets.
[p.071] The residual value and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually at the closing of the accounts and, if necessary, adjusted so that the balance sheet value is equal to the recoverable amount.
[p.071] The depreciation of property, plant and equipment ends when the asset item is classified as available for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
[p.071] Gains and losses on the disposal or transfer of property, plant or equipment are included in other operating income or expenses.
[p.071] RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS The Group has leased properties, machinery and equipment.
[p.071] The lease contracts are made for a fixed period or are valid until further notice.
[p.071] The contract period for leases valid until further notice is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
[p.071] The contracts may include options to extend the lease.
[p.071] A right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability is recognised for leases when the leased asset is available for use by the Group.
[p.071] Assets and liabilities arising from leases are initially measured at present value.
[p.071] 72
[p.072] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 Right-of-use assets are measured at acquisition cost, which includes the following items: • The original amount of the lease liability (see ‘Lease liabilities’ for more information) • Lease payments made before the beginning of the contract less any incentives received • Initial direct costs • Restoration costs.
[p.072] Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
[p.072] If this interest rate is unknown, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate will be used.
[p.072] This is the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the necessary funds over a similar term and with a similar security.
[p.072] Depreciation for right-of-use assets is usually recognised on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset, or the lease period if shorter.
[p.072] If it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise the purchase option, the useful life will be used as the depreciation period for the asset.
[p.072] The company assesses the impairment of right-of-use assets in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
[p.072] Payments related to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis.
[p.072] Leases with a term of 12 months or less are considered to be short-term leases.
[p.072] Atria does not apply the IFRS 16 standard to intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38.
[p.072] INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill: Goodwill represents the Group’s share of the difference between the consideration transferred and the identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities measured at fair value on the acquisition date.
[p.072] Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
[p.072] For this purpose, goodwill has been allocated to cash-generating units.
[p.072] The Group’s cash-generating units are classified based on subsidiaries’ operations and location.
[p.072] These are Atria Finland, Atria Sweden, Atria Denmark, Atria Estonia and Atria Russia.
[p.072] Goodwill is recognised on the balance sheet at cost less impairment losses.
[p.072] An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
[p.072] Other intangible assets: An Intangible asset is initially capitalised on the balance sheet at cost if the cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the company will receive future economic benefit from the asset.
[p.072] Intangible assets with a limited useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
[p.072] Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested annually for impairment.
[p.072] The depreciation periods are as follows: • Customer and supplier relationships ...........
[p.072] 3–8 years • Trademarks .......................................................5–20 years • Other intangible assets*) ................................
[p.072] 5–10 years *) Includes software and subscription fees, among other items IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS On each balance sheet date, the Group reviews non-current assets for any indications of impairment.
[p.072] If there are such indications, the amount recoverable from the asset is estimated.
[p.072] The amount of cash recoverable from goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is assessed annually and whenever there are indications of impairment.
[p.072] The recoverable amount is the higher of the present value of the future cash flows (value in use) and the fair value of the asset less costs of disposal.
[p.072] If the recoverable amount cannot be assessed per item, the impairment need is observed on the level of cash-flow generating units – that is, at the lowest unit level that is mainly independent of other units and at which cash flows can be distinguished from other cash flows.
[p.072] Impairment loss is recognised if the balance sheet value of the asset is higher than the recoverable amount.
[p.072] Impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
[p.072] If the impairment loss concerns a cash-generating unit, it is first allocated to reduce the goodwill and then to reduce the other assets of the unit pro rata.
[p.072] The useful life of the depreciated asset is re-evaluated in connection with the recognition of an impairment loss.
[p.072] An impairment loss recognised for an asset other than goodwill is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the amount recoverable from the asset.
[p.072] However, the impairment loss may not be reversed in excess of what the asset’s balance sheet value would be without the recognition of the impairment loss.
[p.072] An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is never reversed.
[p.072] INVENTORIES Inventories are measured at cost or probable net realisable value, whichever is lower.
[p.072] The acquisition cost is determined using the average price method.
[p.072] The acquisition cost for finished and unfinished products consists of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs, and the appropriate share of manufacturing-related variable overheads and fixed overheads at a normal level of operations.
[p.072] The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling expenses.
[p.072] BIOLOGICAL ASSETS The Group’s biological assets are living animals.
[p.072] They are measured at fair value less estimated sales-related expenses.
[p.072] Productive animals are included in tangible assets and other animals are included in inventories.

[p.073] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS The fair value of productive animals has been measured at cost less an expense corresponding to a reduction of value in use caused by ageing.
[p.073] There is no available market price for productive animals.
[p.073] The fair value of slaughter animals is equal to their market price, which is based on the company’s slaughter animal procurement/sales.
[p.073] FINANCIAL ASSETS Classification In accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group’s financial assets are classified in the following categories: financial assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
[p.073] The classification is based on business models used for the management of the financial assets and on the contractual cash flows of the financial assets.
[p.073] The purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the transaction date.
[p.073] Financial assets are classified as non-current assets when they fall due more than 12 months from the closing date.
[p.073] If the financial assets are intended to be kept for less than 12 months, they are classified as current assets.
[p.073] The Group derecognises financial assets when it has lost its right to receive the cash flows, or when it has substantially transferred the risks and rewards of ownership to an external party.
[p.073] Financial assets recognised at amortised cost: Trade receivables, loan receivables and other receivables recognised at amortised cost are recognised less expected impairment loss.
[p.073] Trade receivables recognised at fair value in other comprehensive income are recognised at fair value.
[p.073] Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, excluding impairment losses, which are recognised through profit or loss.
[p.073] Non-current trade receivables and interest-bearing loan receivables are primarily payment time provided to secure the supply of meat raw material and loans to primary production customers.
[p.073] These items are subject to the general impairment model.
[p.073] If there is no significant increase in credit risk, the estimated amount of credit losses is based on the expected credit losses of 12 months and, in other cases, on credit losses expected for the entire lifetime.
[p.073] Atria’s trade receivables from consumer goods customers are short-term and do not include significant financial components.
[p.073] These trade receivables are subject to a simplified method in which the estimated amount of credit losses is based on the expected credit losses over the receivables’ lifetime.
[p.073] Some trade receivables in the Group are sold to finance companies.
[p.073] The sold trade receivables are derecognised on the balance sheet when the finance company has settled the payment for the receivables and when all material risks and benefits related to the ownership have transferred to the buyer.
[p.073] Trade receivables that may be sold are classified as financial assets recognised at fair value in other comprehensive income.
[p.073] Equity investments recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income: The ‘other financial assets’ account includes equity investments in other companies (both listed and unlisted shares).
[p.073] The shares are not held for trading.
[p.073] In connection with the original recognition, the Group has made an irreversible selection of their inclusion in this group.
[p.073] Listed shares are recognised at fair value, which is based on their stock market price.
[p.073] Unlisted shares are recognised though valuation methods, or at acquisition price if it essentially corresponds to the fair value.
[p.073] When the shares are disposed of, the balance included in other comprehensive income is reclassified in retained earnings and will not be recognised through profit or loss.
[p.073] At fair value through profit or loss: Derivatives not subject to hedge accounting are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
[p.073] Derivatives are initially recognised on the balance sheet at acquisition price, which is equal to their fair value, and later at the fair value of the end date of the review period.
[p.073] Both unrealised and realised profit or loss attributable to changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss during the period in which they occur.
[p.073] Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, bank deposits withdrawable on demand and other cash.
[p.073] Credit facilities related to Group accounts are included in non-current financial liabilities.
[p.073] FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The Group’s loans are classified either in financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost or in financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
[p.073] Financial liabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an absolute right to postpone the payment of the debt to a date at least 12 months from the end date of the review period.
[p.073] Financial liabilities (or parts thereof) are derecognised on the balance sheet only when the debt no longer exists – that is, when the obligation specified in the contract has been fulfilled or revoked, or has expired.
[p.073] Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost: Loans taken out by the Group are included in financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost.
[p.073] They are initially recognised at fair value, using the effective interest rate method.
[p.073] Following the initial recognition, loans are recognised at amortised cost.
[p.073] Interest on loans is amortised over the loan’s maturity period through profit or loss, using the effective interest rate method.
[p.073] Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss: Financial liabilities recognised at fair value through profit or loss include derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
[p.073] Both unrealised and realised profit or loss attributable to changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised through profit or loss during the period in which they occur.

[p.074] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 LEASE LIABILITIES The Group has leased properties, machinery and equipment.
[p.074] When a contract is established, the Group determines whether the contract is a lease contract or includes a lease contract.
[p.074] A lease is a contract or part of a contract that conveys the right to use the underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
[p.074] Lease contracts are made for a fixed period or are valid until further notice.
[p.074] The contract period for leases valid until further notice is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
[p.074] The contracts may include options to extend the lease.
[p.074] A right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability is recognised for leases when the leased asset is available for use by the Group.
[p.074] Liabilities arising from leases are initially measured at present value.
[p.074] Lease liabilities include the net fair value of the following lease payments: • Fixed payments • Variable payments that are based on an index or price level and that are initially measured using the index or price on the contract date • Amounts that the Group is expected to pay based on residual value guarantees • The execution price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise the option • Payments arising from the premature termination of a lease if the exercise of this option has been taken into account in the lease period • Lease payments based on options to extend a lease if it is reasonably certain these options will be exercised.
[p.074] Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
[p.074] If this interest rate is not known, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate will be used.
[p.074] This is the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary for an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset over a similar term and with a similar security in a similar economic environment.
[p.074] To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses, as far as possible, financing that it has recently been provided by an external party, adjusted for changes in financial circumstances that have occurred since the financing was granted.
[p.074] The Group is exposed to possible increases in lease payments based on an index or price level.
[p.074] These are not taken into account in lease liabilities until their materialisation.
[p.074] When changes in lease payments based on an index or price level are materialised, lease liabilities are reviewed and are adjusted against the right-of-use asset.
[p.074] Lease payments to be made are allocated to equity and financial expenses.
[p.074] Financial expenses are recognised through profit or loss over the lease period so that the interest rate for the remaining liabilities remains the same for each reporting period.
[p.074] Payments related to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis.
[p.074] Leases with a term of 12 months or less are considered to be short-term leases.
[p.074] Atria does not apply the IFRS 16 standard to leases of intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38.
[p.074] HEDGE ACCOUNTING Derivative contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
[p.074] The recognition of changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether the derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting and if so, on the hedged item.
[p.074] Derivatives not subject to hedge accounting are defined as hedges of interest rate, currency or electricity price risks associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
[p.074] When a derivative is subject to hedge accounting, the Group documents the relationship between each hedging instrument and the hedged asset, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy applied to it, at the beginning of the hedging arrangement.
[p.074] Through this process, the hedging instrument is connected to the assets and liabilities or the forecast transactions related to the instrument.
[p.074] Risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions are also documented.
[p.074] The Group documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
[p.074] The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is 12 months or less.
[p.074] Derivatives held for trading are classified as current assets or liabilities.
[p.074] Valuation principles: The fair value of forward exchange agreements is calculated by applying the forward rate on the balance sheet date.
[p.074] The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the future cash flows using interest rate curves for the currencies in question.
[p.074] Electricity derivatives are measured at fair value using the market prices at the balance sheet date.
[p.074] Cash flow hedge: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
[p.074] The gain or loss related to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement under the appropriate item.
[p.074] Gains and losses accumulated in equity are reclassified in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when the forecast purchase that is hedged takes place).
[p.074] However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS 75
[p.075] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IFRS example, inventories or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial acquisition cost of the asset.
[p.075] The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in costs of goods sold in the case of inventories, or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.
[p.075] When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement only when the forecast transaction occurs.
[p.075] When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement under the appropriate item.
[p.075] ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their balance sheet value is to be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
[p.075] This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and is subject only to terms that are usual and customary.
[p.075] Furthermore, management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to occur within one year of the date of classification.
[p.075] Immediately before being classified as held for sale, these assets are measured in accordance with the applicable IFRS standards.
[p.075] Thereafter, the assets are measured at the lower of their balance sheet value and fair value less cost to sell.
[p.075] These assets are no longer depreciated after the classification.
[p.075] EQUITY Ordinary shares are presented as share capital.
[p.075] Expenses related to the issue or acquisition of equity instruments are presented as a deductible item under equity.
[p.075] If a Group company acquires shares in the company, the consideration paid for them and the expenses arising directly from the acquisition, taking into consideration the tax effect, are deducted from the shareholders’ equity until the shares are either cancelled or reissued.
[p.075] If the shares are reissued, the consideration received for them less transaction costs directly attributable to the shares is included in the shareholders’ equity, taking into consideration the tax effect.
[p.075] PROVISIONS A provision is entered when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
[p.075] Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenses required to cover the obligation.
[p.075] The amounts of provisions are reviewed on each balance sheet date and adjusted to correspond to the best estimate at that time.
[p.075] Changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement in the same item in which the original provision was entered.
[p.075] REVENUE RECOGNITION Atria sells food products, animal feed, traded animals and services.
[p.075] Sales revenue is recognised based on customer contracts.
[p.075] The contracts specify the contractual obligations and the prices applicable to them.
[p.075] Atria does not have consolidated contractual obligations or obligations to be met over time, advance payments or warranty obligations.
[p.075] Atria recognises both the revenue and the receivable when control over the goods or service is transferred to the customer.
[p.075] Delivery usually takes place in Finland within 24 hours, and control and risks are transferred in connection with delivery.
[p.075] In export deals, the company estimates the time when control transfers to the customer specific to each delivery in accordance with the terms and time of delivery.
[p.075] Sales prices are not adjusted for the time value of money, because the period between the handover of the products and the payment made by the customer is less than a year.
[p.075] Atria always allocates discounts, as well as any refunds following the sale, to the month of delivery, taking the customers’ full-year volume into account.
[p.075] In the recognition of sales revenue, Atria has identified two customer groups: consumer goods customers and primary production customers.
[p.075] Atria presents sales divided into these two revenue streams as part of the segment information in Note 1 and the division of receivables in Note 20.
[p.075] Atria considers these two customer groups to be the most material in terms of understanding the nature of sales revenue and cash flow arising from customer contracts.
[p.075] Most contracts with customers concern the sale of consumer products.
[p.075] Consumer goods customers are primarily central wholesale businesses.
[p.075] In addition, Atria sells traded animals and animal feed to primary production customers.
[p.075] EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension obligations: The Group companies have various local pension arrangements in their countries of operation.
[p.075] Pension arrangements are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit pension plans.
[p.075] In defined contribution plans, the Group makes fixed payments into a separate unit.
[p.075] The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make additional payments if the recipient of the payments cannot pay the pension benefits in question.
[p.075] All plans that do not fulfil these conditions are defined benefit pension plans.
[p.075] Payments made into defined contribution plans are recognised in the income statement in the reporting period to which they apply.
[p.075] The Group’s pension plans are mainly defined contribution plans.
[p.075] In defined benefit plans the company still has an ongoing obligation for the plan even after the payment for the period has been made.

[p.076] Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as equity refunds or a charge in other comprehensive income in the financial period in which they occur.
[p.076] Share-based payments: The Group has an incentive programme for the management where the payments are made in part as company shares and in part as cash.
[p.076] The remuneration awarded under the programme is measured at fair value at the time of awarding, and recognised in the income statement as an expense arising from employee benefits spread over the earning and engagement period.
[p.076] The amount of money paid in the arrangement is remeasured using the review period’s closing share price and recognised in the income statement as an expense from employee benefits spread over from the day of awarding until the money is transferred to the recipient.
[p.076] The final amount of the expense depends on the extent to which the conditions of the incentive programme are met.
[p.076] RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Research expenditure is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
[p.076] Expenditure related to individual projects is capitalised on the balance sheet when there is enough certainty that the product in question is technically viable and that the product is likely to generate future economic benefits.
[p.076] Capitalised development expenditure is recognised in project-specific expenses over the useful life of the product.
[p.076] The asset is amortised from the time it is ready for use.
[p.076] The Group has no capitalised development expenses.
[p.076] GOVERNMENT GRANTS Grants received as compensation for expenses are recognised in the income statement, while expenses connected with the grant are entered as costs.
[p.076] Such grants are recognised under other operating income.
[p.076] The nature of the grants varies between countries, and the grants are only recognised after all the terms and conditions of the grant have been met, so the company does not have a repayment obligation arising from grants received.
[p.076] Government grants – such as grants received for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment – are recognised as a deduction in the balance sheet value of property, plant and equipment when it is reasonably certain that the grant will be received and that the Group company fulfils the prerequisites for receiving the grant.
[p.076] Grants are recognised as income in the form of lower depreciation during the useful life of the asset.
[p.076] INCOME TAXES The consolidated income statement includes the current taxes of Group companies based on taxable profit for the financial period in line with local tax regulations, as well as adjustments to previous years’ taxes and changes in deferred taxes.
[p.076] Taxes are entered in the income statement unless they are related to other comprehensive income or items recognised directly in equity.
[p.076] In such cases, the tax is also entered in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
[p.076] Taxes based on taxable profit for the financial year are calculated using the current tax rate in each country.
[p.076] Deferred taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the balance sheet value and the tax base.
[p.076] The largest temporary differences arise from the depreciation of property, plants and equipment, and fair value measurements in connection with acquisitions.
[p.076] No deferred tax is recognised for non-deductible goodwill impairment, and no deferred tax is recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries if the difference is unlikely to dissolve in the foreseeable future.
[p.076] Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates provided on the balance sheet date.
[p.076] Deferred tax assets are recognised to the amount for which it is likely that taxable profit will be generated in the future against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
[p.076] Deferred tax assets are recognised for confirmed losses made by Group companies to the extent in which it is likely that the assets can be utilised to offset future taxable profits.

[p.084] These calculations, which use cash flow forecasts based on management-approved budgets and strategic targets, are defined before taxes and extend over a five-year period.
[p.084] Cash flows after this period are extrapolated using the growth rates presented above.
[p.084] The most important assumptions used in Atria’s impairment testing for cash flow forecasts are growth in net sales and long-term EBIT margin.
[p.084] The growth and profitability assumptions used are based on the net sales growth rates and profitability levels that business areas will experience in the near future.
[p.084] EBIT margins are expected to be close to the Group’s targeted level of 5%.
[p.084] Growth rate assumptions are moderate in all market areas.
[p.084] Russia’s higher growth projection is due to its higher inflation and the relatively high growth projection for meat consumption.
[p.084] Due to the relatively stable development of the food industry and moderately optimistic growth forecasts, it is unlikely that the growth rate assumptions will generate impairment losses in the future.
[p.084] As regards EBIT margins, impairment losses must be recognised in Atria Sweden, provided that the long-term level remains below 19% of the assumed level.
[p.084] The same applies to Atria Denmark, if the long-term level remains below 32%.
[p.084] Discount rates would give rise to impairment losses (all cash flow forecasts being equal) if they increased by 0.9 percentage points in Sweden and by 1.2 percentage points in Denmark.
[p.084] Clearly higher discount rates would mean that the market situation has changed and that the change could also affect Atria’s cash flows.
[p.084] Therefore, the aforementioned increases in discount rates do not directly mean that there would be a need for impairment.
[p.084] It is the company’s view that no potential change to be expected would result in the recognition of an impairment in Atria Finland or Atria Estonia.
[p.084] A separate test was conducted on a brand with an indefinite useful life for Atria Russia.
[p.084] The brand’s sales have declined and expectations with regard to the recovery of sales are cautious.
[p.084] An impairment of EUR 0.8 million was recognised on the brand.
[p.084] At the end of the financial period, the brand’s value was EUR 1.7 million.
[p.084] Any deterioration in sales expectations or an increase in the discount rate would result in new impairments.

[p.089] SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS, EUR 1,000 Atria Plc has a long-term incentive scheme for key persons for 2018–2020.
[p.089] The share-based incentive scheme aims to encourage Atria’s management to acquire company shares as well as to increase the company’s value through their decisions and actions over the long term.
[p.089] The scheme is based on a share bonus and a cash bonus, and is divided into three one-year periods.
[p.089] The possible bonus in the scheme is based on the company’s earnings per share (70%) and organic growth (30%).
[p.089] The bonuses for each period are paid in equal instalments over three years following the earning period, The cash proportion aims to cover any taxes and tax-like payments incurred by the person due to the bonus.

[p.091] For this reason, the ITP2 pension arrangements managed by Alecta are treated as defined contribution plans in the financial statements.

[p.091] FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The treasury policy approved by the Board of Directors defines the general principles of financial risk management.
[p.091] The Board has delegated the management of financial risks to the Treasury Committee, while the practical management of financial risks is centralised in the Group’s Treasury unit.
[p.091] The goal of financial risk management is to reduce the impact that price fluctuations in the financial markets and other uncertainty factors have on earnings, the balance sheet and cash flow, as well as to ensure sufficient liquidity.
[p.091] Treasury, together with the business areas, aims to identify, assess and hedge against all risks in accordance with the treasury policy.
[p.091] The main risks related to financing are interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity and refinancing risk, and credit risk.
[p.091] Commodity risks and capital structure management are also discussed at the end of this section.
[p.091] Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is managed by dividing financing into instruments with floating and fixed interest rates and by hedging with interest rate derivatives.
[p.091] During the financial year, the Group used interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management.
[p.091] The Group links interest rate risk management to the interest 92

[p.092] The lower the EBITDA is in relation to net financial costs, the larger the share of debt that must have a fixed interest rate.
[p.092] Consolidated interest-bearing debt on the balance sheet date amounted to EUR 218.1 million (228.3 million).
[p.092] The interest-bearing debt includes EUR 184.0 million (194.7 million) in loans and EUR 34.2 million (33.6 million) in lease liabilities.
[p.092] Fixed-rate loans accounted for EUR 30.7 million (31.1 million), or 16.7% (16.0%), of the loans.
[p.092] The ratio of debt with fixed and floating interest rates is at the level defined by the Group’s treasury policy.
[p.092] The interest rate risk is mainly related to the Group’s interest-bearing liabilities, because the amount of money market investments is low, as is the related interest rate risk.
[p.092] The Group’s cash flows from operating activities are to a large extent independent of fluctuations in interest rates.
[p.092] On the balance sheet date, Atria Plc had one interest rate swap subject to hedge accounting.
[p.092] 1.
[p.092] An interest rate swap amounting to EUR 30 million, where Atria pays a fixed interest rate of 0.897% and receives the 6-month Euribor rate.
[p.092] The company will use the interest rate swap to hedge a EUR 30 million loan with a floating interest rate which matures on 25 September 2027 and is included in the fixed-rate interest-bearing debt.
[p.092] The sensitivity analysis of net interest rate expenses is based on a 1% change in interest rates, which is considered to be reasonably realistic.
[p.092] It is calculated for year-end interest-bearing, variable-rate net liabilities that are expected to remain the same over the financial period.
[p.092] The interest rate swap is taken into account in the calculation.
[p.092] In simulations, the same change in interest rate is used for all currencies.
[p.092] On 31 December 2020, net variable-rate liabilities excluding lease liabilities amounted to EUR 126.7 million (159.3 million).
[p.092] At the end of 2020, a +/-1% increase in interest rates corresponded to a change of EUR +/-1.3 million in the Group’s annual interest rate expenses (+/-1.6 million).
[p.092] The effect on equity would be EUR 0.3 million (0.8 million) with an increase of 1% and EUR -0.3 million (-0.8 million) with a decrease of 1%.
[p.092] Currency risk Atria Group operates in many currency zones and is exposed to currency-related risks.
[p.092] Currency risks arise from forecast transactions, assets and liabilities recognised on the balance sheet, and from net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
[p.092] The subsidiaries hedge the currency risk related to commercial operational items according to their currency risk policy for each business area.
[p.092] Each currency risk policy has been approved by the Treasury Committee.
[p.092] In Finland and Sweden, hedge accounting is applied to the currency hedges mentioned above.
[p.092] Currency risk is monitored according to the 12-month rolling cash flow forecast, and hedges are carried out for periods of 1 to 6 months using forward exchange agreements.
[p.092] The cash flows hedged during this time are expected to occur and affect profit or loss.
[p.092] Transaction risks arise from, for example, the euro-denominated meat raw material imports of Atria’s companies in Sweden, as well as from Atria Russia’s USD-denominated meat raw material imports and euro-denominated purchases of goods other than meat.
[p.092] In Atria’s Finnish operations, currency flows and risks are relatively low and are mainly related to USD-denominated exports.
[p.092] Exports to China are invoiced in euros.
[p.092] The Group’s net investments in the operations of foreign subsidiaries are exposed to currency risks.
[p.092] The Treasury Committee decides on net investment hedges on a case-by-case basis.
[p.092] On the balance sheet date, there were no derivative agreements in force for net investment hedging.
[p.092] The parent company grants financing to the subsidiaries in their home currencies and has hedged the currency-denominated loan receivables from the subsidiaries through currency loans and forward exchange agreements.
[p.092] During the financial year, translation differences recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income amounted to EUR -6.8 million (+4.6 million).
[p.092] At the end of the year, the value of net investments exposed to fluctuations of the rouble was EUR 36.7 million (47.9 million).
[p.092] If, at the end of the financial year, the euro had been 10% weaker/stronger than the Swedish krona (all other factors being equal), profit before taxes would have been EUR 0.8 million higher/lower due to the Swedish subsidiaries’ unhedged euro-denominated net position of accounts receivable and accounts payable (0.6 million).
[p.092] The effect on equity would have been EUR 0.8 million (0.7 million).
[p.092] Sensitivity analyses also take into account the effects of currency derivatives, which offset the effects of change in exchange rates.
[p.092] Liquidity and refinancing risk Atria Plc’s Treasury raises the majority of the Group’s interest-bearing capital.
[p.092] Liquidity and refinancing risks are managed through a balanced loan maturity distribution and by having sufficient committed credit facilities with sufficiently long periods of validity at hand, by using several financial institutions and instruments to raise financing and by keeping a sufficient amount of cash funds.
[p.092] Atria uses commercial papers for short-term financing and liquidity management.
[p.092] Unused committed credit facilities totalled EUR 85.0 million (85.0 million) at the end of the year, and EUR 165.0 million of the EUR 200 million commercial paper programme had not been used at the end of the financial year (160.0 million).
[p.092] The average maturity of the Group’s loans and committed credit facilities was 3 years 2 months (3 years 2 months).
[p.092] The main covenant used in loan agreements is a minimum equity ratio covenant of 28%.
[p.092] The Group’s equity ratio has been around 40% for many years, and the Group will continue to ensure an equity ratio higher than the level required by the covenant.
[p.092] According to the terms of loan agreements, the implementation of covenants is reported to financiers quarterly.
[p.092] According to the Group management’s view, there was no significant liquidity accumulation in financial assets or financial sources.

[p.093] The figures for derivative liabilities and assets presented in the table are gross amounts.
[p.093] If the figures were offset, derivative liabilities would amount to EUR -5.2 million (-1.4 million).
[p.093] **) Forward exchange agreements implemented in gross amounts.
[p.093] Credit risk Credit risk is managed at Group level in accordance with the Group’s risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors.
[p.093] The credit risk related to financing (counterparty risk) is managed by selecting only well-established highly rated counterparties with good credit ratings.
[p.093] The Group’s liquid assets are only invested with counterparties that meet the criteria mentioned above.
[p.093] This is also the procedure when entering into financing and derivative agreements.
[p.093] The credit risk related to derivatives is also reduced by the fact that all payments related to interest rate derivatives are net payments.
[p.093] Atria has only made derivatives with banks that are among Atria’s main lenders.
[p.093] The credit risk of the Group’s operative business is related to our customers, of which the main ones are large retail chains.
[p.093] Part of the Group’s trade receivables are related to feed and animal trading in primary production.
[p.093] The credit risk related to this is higher, but also more dispersed.
[p.093] The Group’s trade receivables are also dispersed over several market areas and many customers.
[p.093] To secure the supply of domestically produced meat raw material in Finland, Atria has granted financing to meat producers.
[p.093] The interest-bearing loan receivables are primarily related to these loans.
[p.093] Credit loss risk is managed with securities, such as credit insurance policies and bank guarantees, as well as with advance invoicing.
[p.093] Each business area has been assigned a separate credit policy that takes into account the special features of the market area.
[p.093] Credit risk is examined and monitored on a case-by-case basis for major customers and customer groups.
[p.093] More detailed information about trade receivables is provided in Note 20.
[p.093] Commodity risk The Group is exposed to commodity risks, with the most significant commodities being meat raw material and electricity.
[p.093] Fluctuations in the price of meat raw material affect profitability in the short term, but efforts are made to pass on the price increases to sales prices as soon as possible.
[p.093] Fluctuations in the price of electricity are hedged with forward electricity agreements according to the Group’s electricity procurement policy.
[p.093] The hedging levels in the policy are shown in the table below.
[p.093] Period Minimum hedging level Maximum hedging level 1–12 months 70% 100% 13–24 months 40% 80% 25–36 months 0% 50% 37–48 months 0% 40% 49–60 months 0% 30% Hedge accounting in accordance with the IFRS is applied to electricity hedges.
[p.093] The valuation differences, EUR -0.9 million (-4.5 million), of the effective portion of electricity derivatives which meet the criteria for hedge accounting were recognised in the equity hedge fund.
[p.093] If the market price for electricity derivatives changed by +/-10% from the level of 31 December 2020, the effect on equity would be EUR +/-1.2 million (+/-1.5 million), on the assumption that all hedges are 100% effective.
[p.093] Capital structure management In capital structure management, the Group aims to ensure normal operating conditions under all circumstances and to maintain an optimal capital structure in terms of capital costs.
[p.093] The Group monitors the development of its capital structure primarily through the equity ratio, for which the Group has set a target level of 40%.
[p.093] Based on this equity ratio, the company estimates that the availability and total cost of new capital are optimal.
[p.093] Equity ratio is affected by the balance sheet total and equity.
[p.093] The company is able to affect the balance sheet total and, thereby, the capital structure through the management of working capital, the amount of investments and the sale of business operations or assets.
[p.093] Correspondingly, the company can affect the amount of its own equity through dividend distribution and share issues.
[p.093] The equity ratio was 46.8% (31 December 2019: 46.9%).
[p.093] In the assessment of investments and divestments, the Group uses the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as reference.
[p.093] This way, the Group seeks to ensure that its assets generate at least an amount corresponding to the average cost of its capital.

[p.096] Markets are regarded as active if listed prices are readily and regularly available from the stock exchange, broker, industry group, price information service or supervisory authority, and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring market events between independent parties.
[p.096] The current purchase price is used as the listed market price for financial assets.
[p.096] Level 2: Fair values can be determined either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
[p.096] A fair value is established through valuation techniques for financial instruments that are not traded in active markets (such as OTC derivatives).
[p.096] These valuation techniques make maximum use of observable market information, when available, and rely as little as possible on company-specific assessments.
[p.096] If all significant input required for determining the fair value of the instrument is observable, the instrument is on level 2.
[p.096] Level 3: Fair values are not based on verifiable market prices.
[p.096] If one or more significant piece of input information is not based on observable market information, the instrument is classified as level 3.
[p.096] Assessments by external parties are used to measure financial instruments and, if such assessments are not available, the company’s own calculations/assessments are used.

[p.100] The translation differences related to Pit-Product accumulated by 31 December 2020 were approximately EUR -45 million.
[p.100] The translation difference has accumulated from changes in exchange rates during the ownership of Pit-Product.
[p.100] Atria acquired Pit-Product in 2005.
[p.100] At the time, the exchange rate of the Russian rouble against the euro was 34 and at the end of 2020, it was roughly 92.
[p.100] When disposing of a foreign subsidiary, the translation differences related to the company in question and previously recognised in equity are recognised through profit or loss.
[p.100] Given that the accumulated translation differences already decrease the Group’s equity, the recognition will not have an impact on its equity ratio or cash flow.
[p.100] The translation differences will be recognised once the deal has been finalised.
[p.100] The final transaction price will be determined on the date of the transaction and the divestment is not expected to have any other material impact on the consolidated result.
[p.100] After the review period, Atria announced the initiation of investment planning for the restructuring of Atria Sweden’s production lines.
[p.100] This would increase their productivity.
[p.100] The investment is estimated to amount to EUR 30 million.
[p.100] The investment project will review the restructuring of the production lines, any relocations and the investment needs related to the construction of new production lines in detail.
[p.100] The project will investigate the possibility to relocate production from the Malmö plant to Sköllersta.
[p.100] The potential decision to invest will be made after the planning phase.
[p.100] If implemented, the project is expected to be completed during 2023.

[p.104] Depreciation is implemented on a straight-line basis over the service life of the assets.
[p.104] Contributions received for the acquisition of tangible assets are recognised as a decrease in acquisition costs.
[p.104] These contributions are not significant.
[p.104] The depreciation periods are as follows: Buildings Seinäjoki 40 years other locations 25 years Machinery and equipment Seinäjoki 10 years other locations 7 years Software 5 years Other long-term items 10 years Investments under non-current assets are originally entered at acquisition price.
[p.104] The book value of investments is assessed annually in connection with the preparation of the financial statements and, if the criteria of Chapter 5, section 13 of the Accounting Act are met, revaluations can be made as necessary.
[p.104] Items presented in foreign currencies Items expressed in foreign currencies have been converted into euro at the exchange rate quoted by the European Central Bank.

[p.104] Derivative financial instruments Of financial instruments, derivatives are measured at fair value in accordance with the alternative practice presented in chapter 5, section 2a of the Accounting Act.
[p.104] Derivatives are accounted for as hedging.
[p.104] The company enters into derivative contracts mainly to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
[p.104] The derivatives used are forward exchange agreements and interest rate swaps.
[p.104] The company recognises derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet when the derivative contract enters into force Interest rate swaps have been recognised in accordance with this principle since the 2018 financial year.
[p.104] Derivatives are measured at fair value on the balance sheet date, and gains and losses arising from the valuation difference are recognised in financial income and expenses in the income statement.

[p.113] Our opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Board of Directors.
[p.113] What we have audited We have audited the financial statements of Atria Plc (business identity code 0841066-1) for the period of 1 January to 31 December 2020.
[p.113] The financial statements comprise: • the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies • the parent company’s balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows and notes.
[p.113] BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland.
[p.113] Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.
[p.113] We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
[p.113] Independence We are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
[p.113] To the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.
[p.113] The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 4 to the Financial Statements.
[p.113] OUR AUDIT APPROACH Overview • Overall group materiality: 2,600,000 euros.
[p.113] • Audit scope: The audit scope included the parent company of the Group and subsidiaries in Finland, Sweden, Russia, Estonia and Denmark.
[p.113] The following items have been recognised as key audit matters: • Revenue recognition • Valuation of goodwill and trademarks • Valuation of inventory • Valuation of subsidiary shares and loan receivables (applies only to the parent company) As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
[p.113] In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
[p.113] Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
[p.113] An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
[p.113] Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error.
[p.113] They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
[p.113] Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below.
[p.113] These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.
[p.113] Materiality Group scoping Key audit matters 114
[p.114] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 Overall group materiality 2,600,000 euros How we determined it Materiality has been determined taking into consideration net sales, gross profit and profit before taxes.
[p.114] Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied We chose profit before taxes as the main benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark commonly used by users of the financial statements to measure the performance of the group.
[p.114] We have also chosen net sales and gross margin as benchmarks as we consider these to be relevant for the users of the financial statements when assessing the performance of the group.
[p.114] How we tailored our group audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.
[p.114] Atria group had four reportable segments during the financial year: Atria Finland, Atria Sweden, Atria Russia and Atria Denmark and Estonia.
[p.114] Our audit procedures addressed all four reportable segments.
[p.114] Our audit scope included the parent company and subsidiaries in Finland, Sweden, Russia, Estonia and Denmark.
[p.114] We have pre-defined the types of audit procedures aimed at the financial information of each part of the group.
[p.114] In cases where a group component auditor has performed the audit work, we have instructed their work with group audit instructions which have included e.g. our risk assessment, materiality, audit approach and centralized audit procedures.
[p.114] KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period.
[p.114] These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
[p.114] As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
[p.114] Key audit matter in the audit of the group How our audit addressed the key audit matter Revenue recognition Refer to the Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements and Notes 1 and 2 Atria has identified two client segments: consumer product clients and primary production clients.
[p.114] Sales revenue is recognised based on customer contracts.
[p.114] The contracts specify the contractual obligations and the prices applicable to them.
[p.114] Revenue recognition is considered a key audit matter in the audit of the group due to the financial significance of net sales in the financial statements.
[p.114] Our audit procedures included for example the following procedures: • We evaluated the internal control activities and controls over revenue recognition and assessed the appropriateness of the accounting policies related to revenue recognition by comparing those to the applicable accounting standards.
[p.114] • We tested the cut-off of individual sales transactions by comparing to delivery documents and by checking significant credit notes issued after year-end.
[p.114] • We tested discounts and rebate accruals on a sample basis.
[p.114] • We tested a sample of other revenue transactions based on the results of data analysis procedures.
[p.114] Valuation of goodwill and trademarks Refer to Accounting policies for the consolidated financial statements and Note 15 The group tests annually goodwill and the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment.
[p.114] Goodwill in the Atria Group consolidated balance sheet totalled to 165 million euros and trademarks with indefinite useful lives to 55 million euros at 31 December 2020.
[p.114] Impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to significant management judgement.
[p.114] The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on estimates of future cash flows.
[p.114] Key assumptions in these estimates include e.g. growth in net sales, profitability levels, and discount rates.
[p.114] The valuation of goodwill and trademarks is considered a key audit matter in the audit of the group due to its financial significance as well as due to the high degree of management judgement involved in the impairment testing.
[p.114] Our audit procedures included for example the following procedures: • We discussed the accounting policies and significant management’s estimates and assumptions.
[p.114] • Where possible, we compared the key variables of discount rate and long-term growth rate of net sales to information generally available at the market.
[p.114] • We reconciled the estimates of future cash flows to the strategy information approved by the board of directors.
[p.114] • We tested the appropriateness of the key assumptions applied to the cash flow estimates and consistency of accounting policies in relation to previous accounting periods.
[p.114] • We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates including growth of net sales and profit margin by comparing these to actual results for the period.
[p.114] • We tested mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
[p.114] • We performed sensitivity analyses for the key variables e.g. to test information provided in note 15 regarding sensitivity of the calculations.

[p.115] The cost for finished and unfinished products consists of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and the appropriate share of manufacturing-related variable overheads and fixed overheads at a normal level of operations.
[p.115] The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated selling expenses.
[p.115] Valuation of inventories is considered a key audit matter in the audit of the group due to its financial significance and as it includes judgement as described in the accounting principles.
[p.115] Our audit procedures included for example the following procedures: • We evaluated the internal key controls of inventories and the purchasing process.
[p.115] • We tested the appropriateness of the accounting principles relating to valuation of inventories.
[p.115] • We tested price variances of single inventory items on a sample basis.
[p.115] • We tested the appropriateness of key assumptions used in the valuation of inventory and the mathematic accuracy of the calculations.
[p.115] Key audit matter in the audit of the group How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of subsidiary shares and loan receivables Refer to Notes to the parent company financial statements 3.2 and 3.3 Value of shares in subsidiaries in the Atria Plc financial statements at 31 December 2020 totalled 283 million euros and loan receivables from group companies 127 million euros.
[p.115] Valuation of shares in subsidiaries and loan receivables in accordance with the Accounting Act is subject to management judgement.
[p.115] These valuations include significant management judgement in relation to for example subsidiaries projected future cash flows.
[p.115] Valuation of subsidiary shares and loan receivables is considered a key audit matter in the audit of the parent company due to its financial significance as well as due to the high degree of management judgement involved in the valuation.
[p.115] Our audit procedures included for example the following procedures: • We assessed the book value of Atria Plc’s shares in subsidiaries based on the subsidiary’s equity and the management estimates of the projected future cash flows.
[p.115] • We discussed with the management the most significant assumptions used in the valuation of shares in subsidiaries and assessed the assumptions of the valuation calculations.
[p.115] • We evaluated the reliability of estimates from previous years by comparing those to the actual results for the period.
[p.115] There are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the audit of the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.
[p.115] RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements.
[p.115] The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
[p.115] In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting.
[p.115] The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
[p.115] AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
[p.115] Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
[p.115] Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
[p.115] As part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
[p.115] We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
[p.115] The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
[p.115] • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company’s or the group’s internal control.

[p.116] • Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the Managing Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company’s or the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
[p.116] If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
[p.116] Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
[p.116] However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
[p.116] • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the financial statements give a true and fair view.
[p.116] • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
[p.116] We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.
[p.116] We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
[p.116] We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
[p.116] We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
[p.116] From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
[p.116] We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

[p.116] OTHER INFORMATION The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information.
[p.116] The other information comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
[p.116] Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.
[p.116] In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
[p.116] With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
[p.116] In our opinion • the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements • the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.
[p.116] If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
[p.116] We have nothing to report in this regard.

[p.126] Front page Atria in brief Atria’s key indicators CEO’s review Strategy 2021–2025 Strategy 2016–2020 Operating environment Business area reviews Atria Finland Atria Sweden Atria Denmark & Estonia Atria Russia Research and Development Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Corporate Governance Auditor’s report Corporate Governance Statement Investor reporting Contact information Atria’s Annual Report 2020 The Board of Directors has deemed that the following members of the Board are dependent of Atria: Seppo Paavola, Jukka Kaikkonen, Ahti Ritola, Pasi Korhonen and Kjell-Göran Paxal.
[p.126] These members are either full-time farmers who have – or are members of the operative management of a company that has – a customer, supplier or cooperation relationship with Atria Group that is significant for the entrepreneur/company in question.
[p.126] Based on an overall evaluation, the Board has deemed that Harri Sivula is independent of the company, even though he has served as a member of Atria’s Board of Directors for more than ten years.
[p.126] Of the Board members, Ahti Ritola is a member of the Board of Directors of Itikka Co-operative, a significant shareholder, and Pasi Korhonen and Jukka Kaikkonen are members of the Board of Directors of Lihakunta, a significant shareholder.
[p.126] They are therefore dependent of a significant shareholder.
[p.126] Seppo Paavola is a member of the Supervisory Board of Itikka Co-operative, a significant shareholder.
[p.126] Membership of the Supervisory Board of a significant shareholder alone has not been deemed to constitute dependence of a significant shareholder.
[p.126] The members of the Board of Directors are obliged to provide the Board with information sufficient to assess their skills and independence and to notify the Board of any changes to the information.
[p.126] 5.4 Principles concerning the diversity of the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board Diversity is part of Atria’s responsible business operations.
[p.126] When planning the composition of Atria’s Board of Directors and/or Supervisory Board, diversity is considered from a variety of perspectives, and the company’s development needs and the scope of its business operations are taken into account.
[p.126] When selecting the members of the Board of Directors and/or Supervisory Board, the goal is that the members’ broad-based expertise and the composition of the Board support the development of Atria’s current and future business operations.
[p.126] A constructively questioning and challenging Board of Directors and Supervisory Board create added value for the company’s operations.
[p.126] This also brings diversity to their work.
[p.126] Atria seeks to promote the selection of members who are as qualified as possible and have broad and varied experience in various fields and to ensure that candidates of both genders have equal opportunities to be selected on the Board.
[p.126] Atria’s goal is to ensure that both genders are represented on the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board, and that the representative of the minority gender is given preference if two candidates are equally competent.
[p.126] In addition to the aforementioned areas, the selection considers the candidates’ ability to spend a sufficient amount of time on their Board duties.
[p.126] 5.4.1.
[p.126] Diversity of the Board of Directors The selection aims to ensure that the Board has core competence from a variety of fields within the value chain of Atria’s business operations, a wide range of experience of entrepreneurship and business activities, as well as know-how and understanding of international business required by the company’s strategy.
[p.126] Rather than every member of the Board being qualified in all of the aforementioned areas, the aim is that every Board member possesses some skills in one or more of the aforementioned areas.
[p.126] The diversity of the Board of Directors is furthermore supported by the members’ other complementary skills, their training and experience from different occupational fields and industries, as well as by a consideration of the Board members’ age and gender distribution.
[p.126] In addition to the aforementioned areas, the selection considers the candidates’ ability to spend a sufficient amount of time on their Board duties.
[p.126] 5.4.2 Diversity of the Supervisory Board When selecting members of the Supervisory Board, the goal is to consider their expertise in the meat industry and its various types of production.
[p.126] Diversity is also ensured by selecting members who represent various areas of Finland.
[p.126] In addition, the age and gender distribution of the members of the Supervisory Board are considered, along with other skills that support the Board’s work.
[p.126] 5.4.3.
[p.126] Implementation of the diversity principles To achieve the goals for the principles on diversity, the company has sought and seeks to actively communicate these goals to Atria’s shareholders.
[p.126] During the 2020 financial year, one member of the Board of Directors was a woman, and the other members were men, meaning that the minority gender represented 12.5% of all Board members.
[p.126] During the 2020 financial year, one member of the Supervisory Board was a woman, and the other members were men, meaning that the minority gender represented 5.2% of all Board members.
[p.126] The company’s goal of both genders being represented has therefore been met.
[p.126] The company’s other goals concerning the diversity of the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board have also been met with regard to the Board members’ in-depth knowledge of the meat business and commercial and industrial operations, and the Supervisory Board members’ expertise in the meat industry and various types of production, as well as geographical representation.
[p.126] 6.
